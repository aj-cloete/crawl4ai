## Best practice workflows[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/best-practice-workflows#best-practice-workflows "Direct link to Best practice workflows")
### Version control your dbt project[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/best-practice-workflows#version-control-your-dbt-project "Direct link to Version control your dbt project")
All dbt projects should be managed in version control. Git branches should be created to manage development of new features and bug fixes. All code changes should be reviewed by a colleague (or yourself) in a Pull Request prior to merging into your production branch, such as `main`.
Git guide
We've codified our best practices in Git, in our [Git guide](https://github.com/dbt-labs/corp/blob/main/git-guide.md).
### Use separate development and production environments[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/best-practice-workflows#use-separate-development-and-production-environments "Direct link to Use separate development and production environments")
dbt makes it easy to maintain separate production and development environments through the use of targets within a profile. We recommend using a `dev` target when running dbt from your command line and only running against a `prod` target when running from a production deployment. You can read more [about managing environments here](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/environments-in-dbt).
### Use a style guide for your project[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/best-practice-workflows#use-a-style-guide-for-your-project "Direct link to Use a style guide for your project")
SQL styles, field naming conventions, and other rules for your dbt project should be codified, especially on projects where multiple dbt users are writing code.
We've made our [style guide](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/0-how-we-style-our-dbt-projects) public – these can act as a good starting point for your own style guide.
## Best practices in dbt projects[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/best-practice-workflows#best-practices-in-dbt-projects "Direct link to Best practices in dbt projects")
### Use the ref function[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/best-practice-workflows#use-the-ref-function "Direct link to Use the ref function")
The [ref](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/ref) function is what makes dbt so powerful! Using the `ref` function allows dbt to infer dependencies, ensuring that models are built in the correct order. It also ensures that your current model selects from upstream tables and views in the same environment that you're working in. Always use the `ref` function when selecting from another model, rather than using the direct relation reference (e.g. `my_schema.my_table`).
### Limit references to raw data[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/best-practice-workflows#limit-references-to-raw-data "Direct link to Limit references to raw data")
Your dbt project will depend on raw data stored in your database. Since this data is normally loaded by third parties, the structure of it can change over time – tables and columns may be added, removed, or renamed. When this happens, it is easier to update models if raw data is only referenced in one place.
We recommend defining your raw data as [sources](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/sources), and selecting from the source rather than using the direct relation reference. Our dbt projects don't contain any direct relation references in any models.
### Rename and recast fields once[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/best-practice-workflows#rename-and-recast-fields-once "Direct link to Rename and recast fields once")
Raw data is generally stored in a source-conformed structure, that is, following the schema and naming conventions that the source defines. Not only will this structure differ between different sources, it is also likely to differ from the naming conventions you wish to use for analytics.
The first layer of transformations in a dbt project should:
  * Select from only one source
  * Rename fields and tables to fit the conventions you wish to use within your project, for example, ensuring all timestamps are named `<event>_at`. These conventions should be declared in your project coding conventions (see above).
  * Recast fields into the correct data type, for example, changing dates into UTC and prices into dollar amounts.


All subsequent data models should be built on top of these models, reducing the amount of duplicated code.
Earlier versions of this documentation recommended implementing “base models” as the first layer of transformation, and gave advice on the SQL within these models. We realized that while the reasons behind this convention were valid, the specific advice around "base models" represented an opinion, so we moved it out of the official documentation.
You can instead find our opinions on [how we structure our dbt projects](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview).
### Break complex models up into smaller pieces[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/best-practice-workflows#break-complex-models-up-into-smaller-pieces "Direct link to Break complex models up into smaller pieces")
Complex models often include multiple Common Table Expressions (CTEs). In dbt, you can instead separate these CTEs into separate models that build on top of each other. It is often a good idea to break up complex models when:
  * A CTE is duplicated across two models. Breaking the CTE into a separate model allows you to reference the model from any number of downstream models, reducing duplicated code.
  * A CTE changes the grain of a the data it selects from. It's often useful to test any transformations that change the grain (as in, what one record represents) of your data. Breaking a CTE into a separate model allows you to test this transformation independently of a larger model.
  * The SQL in a query contains many lines. Breaking CTEs into separate models can reduce the cognitive load when another dbt user (or your future self) is looking at the code.


### Group your models in directories[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/best-practice-workflows#group-your-models-in-directories "Direct link to Group your models in directories")
Within your `models/` directory, you can have any number of nested subdirectories. We leverage directories heavily, since using a nested structure within directories makes it easier to:
  * Configure groups of models, by specifying configurations in your `dbt_project.yml` file.
  * Run subsections of your DAG, by using the [model selection syntax](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/syntax).
  * Communicate modeling steps to collaborators
  * Create conventions around the allowed upstream dependencies of a model, for example, "models in the `marts` directory can only select from other models in the `marts` directory, or from models in the `staging` directory".


### Add tests to your models[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/best-practice-workflows#add-tests-to-your-models "Direct link to Add tests to your models")
dbt provides a framework to test assumptions about the results generated by a model. Adding tests to a project helps provide assurance that both:
  * your SQL is transforming data in the way you expect, and
  * your source data contains the values you expect


Our [style guide](https://github.com/dbt-labs/corp/blob/main/dbt_style_guide.md) recommends that at a minimum, every model should have a primary key that is tested to ensure it is unique, and not null.
### Consider the information architecture of your data warehouse[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/best-practice-workflows#consider-the-information-architecture-of-your-data-warehouse "Direct link to Consider the information architecture of your data warehouse")
When a user connects to a data warehouse via a SQL client, they often rely on the names of schemas, relations, and columns, to understand the data they are presented with. To improve the information architecture of a data warehouse, we:
  * Use [custom schemas](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/custom-schemas) to separate relations into logical groupings, or hide intermediate models in a separate schema. Generally, these custom schemas align with the directories we use to group our models, and are configured from the `dbt_project.yml` file.
  * Use prefixes in table names (for example, `stg_`, `fct_` and `dim_`) to indicate which relations should be queried by end users.


### Choose your materializations wisely[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/best-practice-workflows#choose-your-materializations-wisely "Direct link to Choose your materializations wisely")
[materialization](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/materializations) determine the way models are built through configuration. As a general rule:
  * Views are faster to build, but slower to query compared to tables.
  * Incremental models provide the same query performance as tables, are faster to build compared to the table materialization, however they introduce complexity into a project.


We often:
  * Use views by default
  * Use ephemeral models for lightweight transformations that shouldn't be exposed to end-users
  * Use tables for models that are queried by BI tools
  * Use tables for models that have multiple descendants
  * Use incremental models when the build time for table models exceeds an acceptable threshold


## Pro-tips for workflows[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/best-practice-workflows#pro-tips-for-workflows "Direct link to Pro-tips for workflows")
### Use the model selection syntax when running locally[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/best-practice-workflows#use-the-model-selection-syntax-when-running-locally "Direct link to Use the model selection syntax when running locally")
When developing, it often makes sense to only run the model you are actively working on and any downstream models. You can choose which models to run by using the [model selection syntax](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/syntax).
### Run only modified models to test changes ("slim CI")[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/best-practice-workflows#run-only-modified-models-to-test-changes-slim-ci "Direct link to Run only modified models to test changes \("slim CI"\)")
To merge code changes with confidence, you want to know that those changes will not cause breakages elsewhere in your project. For that reason, we recommend running models and tests in a sandboxed environment, separated from your production data, as an automatic check in your git workflow. (If you use GitHub and dbt, read about [how to set up CI jobs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/ci-jobs).
At the same time, it costs time (and money) to run and test all the models in your project. This inefficiency feels especially painful if your PR only proposes changes to a handful of models.
By comparing to artifacts from a previous production run, dbt can determine which models are modified and build them on top of of their unmodified parents.
```
dbt run -s state:modified+ --defer--state path/to/prod/artifactsdbt test-s state:modified+ --defer--state path/to/prod/artifacts
```

By comparing to artifacts from a previous production run, dbt can determine model and test result statuses.
  * `result:fail`
  * `result:error`
  * `result:warn`
  * `result:success`
  * `result:skipped`
  * `result:pass`


For smarter reruns, use the `result:<status>` selector instead of manually overriding dbt commands with the models in scope.
```
dbt run --select state:modified+ result:error+ --defer--state path/to/prod/artifacts
```

  * Rerun all my erroneous models AND run changes I made concurrently that may relate to the erroneous models for downstream use


```
dbt build --select state:modified+ result:error+ --defer--state path/to/prod/artifacts
```

  * Rerun and retest all my erroneous models AND run changes I made concurrently that may relate to the erroneous models for downstream use


```
dbt build --select state:modified+ result:error+ result:fail+ --defer--state path/to/prod/artifacts
```

  * Rerun all my erroneous models AND all my failed tests
  * Rerun all my erroneous models AND run changes I made concurrently that may relate to the erroneous models for downstream use
  * There's a failed test that's unrelated to modified or error nodes(think: source test that needs to refresh a data load in order to pass)


```
dbt test--select result:fail --excludeexample test--defer--state path/to/prod/artifacts
```

  * Rerun all my failed tests and exclude tests that I know will still fail
  * This can apply to updates in source data during the "EL" process that need to be rerun after they are refreshed


> Note: If you're using the `--state target/` flag, `result:error` and `result:fail` flags can only be selected concurrently(in the same command) if using the `dbt build` command. `dbt test` will overwrite the `run_results.json` from `dbt run` in a previous command invocation.
Only supported by v1.1 or newer.
By comparing to a `sources.json` artifact from a previous production run to a current `sources.json` artifact, dbt can determine which sources are fresher and run downstream models based on them.
```
# job 1dbt source freshness # must be run to get previous state
```

Test all my sources that are fresher than the previous run, and run and test all models downstream of them:
```
# job 2dbt source freshness # must be run again to compare current to previous statedbt build --select source_status:fresher+ --state path/to/prod/artifacts
```

To learn more, read the docs on [state](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/syntax#about-node-selection).
## Pro-tips for dbt Projects[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/best-practice-workflows#pro-tips-for-dbt-projects "Direct link to Pro-tips for dbt Projects")
### Limit the data processed when in development[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/best-practice-workflows#limit-the-data-processed-when-in-development "Direct link to Limit the data processed when in development")
In a development environment, faster run times allow you to iterate your code more quickly. We frequently speed up our runs by using a pattern that limits data based on the [target](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/target) name:
```
selectfrom event_tracking.events{%if target.name =='dev'%}where created_at >= dateadd('day',-3,current_date){% endif %}
```

Another option is to use the [environment variable `DBT_CLOUD_INVOCATION_CONTEXT`](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/environment-variables#dbt-platform-context). This environment variable provides metadata about the execution context of dbt. The possible values are `prod`, `dev`, `staging`, and `ci`.
**Example usage** :
```
{% if env_var('DBT_CLOUD_INVOCATION_CONTEXT') != 'prod' %}
```

### Use grants to manage privileges on objects that dbt creates[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/best-practice-workflows#use-grants-to-manage-privileges-on-objects-that-dbt-creates "Direct link to Use grants to manage privileges on objects that dbt creates")
Use `grants` in [resource configs](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/grants) to ensure that permissions are applied to the objects created by dbt. By codifying these grant statements, you can version control and repeatably apply these permissions.
### Separate source-centric and business-centric transformations[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/best-practice-workflows#separate-source-centric-and-business-centric-transformations "Direct link to Separate source-centric and business-centric transformations")
When modeling data, we frequently find there are two stages:
  1. Source-centric transformations to transform data from different sources into a consistent structure, for example, re-aliasing and recasting columns, or unioning, joining or deduplicating source data to ensure your model has the correct grain; and
  2. Business-centric transformations that transform data into models that represent entities and processes relevant to your business, or implement business definitions in SQL.


We find it most useful to separate these two types of transformations into different models, to make the distinction between source-centric and business-centric logic clear.
### Managing whitespace generated by Jinja[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/best-practice-workflows#managing-whitespace-generated-by-jinja "Direct link to Managing whitespace generated by Jinja")
If you're using macros or other pieces of Jinja in your models, your compiled SQL (found in the `target/compiled` directory) may contain unwanted whitespace. Check out the [Jinja documentation](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/templates/#whitespace-control) to learn how to control generated whitespace.

Note that this best practices guide doesn't yet use the [new YAML specification](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/latest-metrics-spec). We're working on updating this guide to use the new spec and file structure soon!
To read more about the new spec, see [Creating metrics](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/metrics-overview).
Flying cars, hoverboards, and true self-service analytics: this is the future we were promised. The first two might still be a few years out, but real self-service analytics is here today. With dbt's Semantic Layer, you can resolve the tension between accuracy and flexibility that has hampered analytics tools for years, empowering everybody in your organization to explore a shared reality of metrics. Best of all for analytics engineers, building with these new tools will significantly [DRY](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/dry) up and simplify your codebase. As you'll see, the deep interaction between your dbt models and the Semantic Layer make your dbt project the ideal place to craft your metrics.
## Learning goals[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-1-intro#learning-goals "Direct link to Learning goals")
  * ❓ Understand the **purpose and capabilities** of the **Semantic Layer** , particularly MetricFlow as the engine that powers it.
  * 🧱 Familiarity with the core components of MetricFlow — **semantic models and metrics** — and how they work together.
  * 🔁 Know how to **refactor** dbt models for the Semantic Layer.
  * 🏅 Aware of **best practices** to take maximum advantage of the Semantic Layer.


## Guide structure overview[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-1-intro#guide-structure-overview "Direct link to Guide structure overview")
  1. Getting **setup** in your dbt project.
  2. Building a **semantic model** and its fundamental parts: **entities, dimensions, and measures**.
  3. Building a **metric**.
  4. Defining **advanced metrics** : `ratio` and `derived` types.
  5. **File and folder structure** : establishing a system for naming things.
  6. **Refactoring** marts and roll-ups for the Semantic Layer.
  7. Review **best practices**.


If you're ready to ship your users more power and flexibility with less code, let's dive in!
MetricFlow is the engine for defining metrics in dbt and one of the key components of the [Semantic Layer](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/dbt-sl). It handles SQL query construction and defines the specification for dbt semantic models and metrics.
To fully experience the Semantic Layer, including the ability to query dbt metrics via external integrations, you'll need a [dbt Starter, Enterprise, or Enterprise+ accounts](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing/). Refer to [Semantic Layer FAQs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/sl-faqs) for more information.

There are tons of generic data tests defined in open source packages, such as [dbt-utils](https://hub.getdbt.com/dbt-labs/dbt_utils/latest/) and [dbt-expectations](https://hub.getdbt.com/calogica/dbt_expectations/latest/) — the test you're looking for might already be here!
### Generic tests with standard arguments[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/writing-custom-generic-tests#generic-tests-with-standard-arguments "Direct link to Generic tests with standard arguments")
Generic tests are defined in SQL files. Those files can live in two places:
  * `tests/generic/`: that is, a special subfolder named `generic` within your [test paths](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/project-configs/test-paths) (`tests/` by default)
  * `macros/`: Why? Generic tests work a lot like macros, and historically, this was the only place they could be defined. If your generic test depends on complex macro logic, you may find it more convenient to define the macros and the generic test in the same file.


To define your own generic tests, simply create a `test` block called `<test_name>`. All generic tests should accept one or both of the standard arguments:
  * `model`: The resource on which the test is defined, templated out to its relation name. (Note that the argument is always named `model`, even when the resource is a source, seed, or snapshot.)
  * `column_name`: The column on which the test is defined. Not all generic tests operate on the column level, but if they do, they should accept `column_name` as an argument.


Here's an example of an `is_even` schema test that uses both arguments:
tests/generic/test_is_even.sql
```
{% test is_even(model, column_name)%}with validation as(select        {{ column_name }} as even_fieldfrom {{ model }}validation_errors as(select        even_fieldfrom validation-- if this is true, then even_field is actually odd!where(even_field %2)=1select*from validation_errors{% endtest %}
```

If this `select` statement returns zero records, then every record in the supplied `model` argument is even! If a nonzero number of records is returned instead, then at least one record in `model` is odd, and the test has failed.
To use this generic test, specify it by name in the `data_tests` property of a model, source, snapshot, or seed:
With one line of code, you've just created a test! In this example, `users` will be passed to the `is_even` test as the `model` argument, and `favorite_number` will be passed in as the `column_name` argument. You could add the same line for other columns, other models—each will add a new test to your project, _using the same generic test definition_.
### Add description to generic data test logic[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/writing-custom-generic-tests#add-description-to-generic-data-test-logic "Direct link to Add description to generic data test logic")
You can add a description to the Jinja macro that provides the core logic for a data test by including the `description` key under the `macros:` section. You can add descriptions directly to the macro, including descriptions for macro arguments.
Here's an example:
macros/generic/schema.yml
```
macros:-name: test_not_empty_stringdescription: Complementary test to default `not_null` test as it checks that there is not an empty string. It only accepts columns of type string.arguments:-name: model type: stringdescription: Model Name-name: column_nametype: stringdescription: Column name that should not be an empty string
```

In this example:
  * When documenting custom test macros in a `schema.yml` file, add the `test_` prefix to the macro name. For example, if the test block's name is `not_empty_string`, then the macro's name would be `test_not_empty_string`.
  * We've provided a description at the macro level, explaining what the test does and any relevant notes.
  * Each argument (like `model`, `column_name`) also includes a description to clarify its purpose.


### Generic tests with additional arguments[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/writing-custom-generic-tests#generic-tests-with-additional-arguments "Direct link to Generic tests with additional arguments")
The `is_even` test works without needing to specify any additional arguments. Other tests, like `relationships`, require more than just `model` and `column_name`. If your custom tests requires more than the standard arguments, include those arguments in the test signature, as `field` and `to` are included below:
tests/generic/test_relationships.sql
```
{% test relationships(model, column_name, field,to)%}with parent as(select        {{ field }} as idfrom {{ to }}child as(select        {{ column_name }} as idfrom {{ model }}select*from childwhere id isnotnulland id notin(select id from parent){% endtest %}
```

When calling this test from a `.yml` file, supply the arguments to the test in a dictionary. Note that the standard arguments (`model` and `column_name`) are provided by the context, so you do not need to define them again.
### Generic tests with default config values[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/writing-custom-generic-tests#generic-tests-with-default-config-values "Direct link to Generic tests with default config values")
It is possible to include a `config()` block in a generic test definition. Values set there will set defaults for all specific instances of that generic test, unless overridden within the specific instance's `.yml` properties.
tests/generic/warn_if_odd.sql
```
{% test warn_if_odd(model, column_name)%}    {{ config(severity ='warn') }}select*from {{ model }}where({{ column_name }} %2)=1{% endtest %}
```

Any time the `warn_if_odd` test is used, it will _always_ have warning-level severity, unless the specific test overrides that value:
### Customizing dbt's built-in tests[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/writing-custom-generic-tests#customizing-dbts-built-in-tests "Direct link to Customizing dbt's built-in tests")
To change the way a built-in generic test works—whether to add additional parameters, re-write the SQL, or for any other reason—you simply add a test block named `<test_name>` to your own project. dbt will favor your version over the global implementation!
tests/generic/<filename>.sql
```
{% test unique(model, column_name)%}-- whatever SQL you'd like!{% endtest %}
```

### Examples[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/writing-custom-generic-tests#examples "Direct link to Examples")
Here's some additional examples of custom generic ("schema") tests from the community:
  * [Creating a custom schema test with an error threshold](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/creating-an-error-threshold-for-schema-tests/966)
  * [Using custom schema tests to only run tests in production](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/conditionally-running-dbt-tests-only-running-dbt-tests-in-production/322)
  * [Additional examples of custom schema tests](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/examples-of-custom-schema-tests/181)

By design, dbt is batch-oriented with jobs having a defined start and end time. But did you know that you can also use dbt to get near real-time data by combining your data warehouse's continuous ingestion with frequent dbt transformations?
This guide covers multiple patterns for achieving near real-time data freshness with dbt:
  1. [Incremental patterns](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns) — `merge` strategies, Change Data Capture (CDC), and microbatch processing
  2. [Warehouse-native features](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/3-warehouse-native-features) — When to use dynamic tables and materialized views
  3. [Lambda views pattern](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/4-lambda-views) — Combining batch and real-time data in a single view
  4. [Views-only pattern](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern) - Maximum freshness for lightweight transformations
  5. [Operational considerations](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/6-operational-considerations) — Challenges, risks, and cost management


Each pattern includes practical code examples, use cases, and tradeoffs to help you choose the right approach.
Anyone can use this guide, but it's primarily for data engineers and architects who want to achieve near real-time data freshness with dbt.
## Where does dbt fit?[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/1-intro#where-does-dbt-fit "Direct link to Where does dbt fit?")
There are two main ways to use dbt to get near real-time data:
  * For near real-time (5 - 15 minutes) — dbt excels at this and is well-suited for most operational dashboards.
  * For true real-time (sub-second) — This requires dedicated streaming databases (ClickHouse, Materialize, Rockset, and so on) in front of or alongside dbt; dbt still owns “analytic” tables and history but not the ultra‑low‑latency read path.


## How dbt achieves near real-time data[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/1-intro#how-dbt-achieves-near-real-time-data "Direct link to How dbt achieves near real-time data")
To achieve real-time data with dbt, we recommend using a two-layer architecture:
#### Ingestion layer[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/1-intro#ingestion-layer "Direct link to Ingestion layer")
Continuous data landing using your data warehouse's streaming ingestion features.
Streaming ingestion features such as [streaming tables](https://docs.databricks.com/en/sql/load-data-streaming-table.html), [Snowpipe](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowpipe-streaming/data-load-snowpipe-streaming-overview), or [Storage Write API](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/write-api-streaming) work well for this. To find streaming ingestion features for your warehouse, refer to the [additional resources](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/3-warehouse-native-features#resources-by-warehouse) section.
#### dbt transformation layer[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/1-intro#dbt-transformation-layer "Direct link to dbt transformation layer")
Run dbt every few minutes to transform the data, and use materialized views or dynamic tables for the lowest-latency reporting.
Specific transformation approaches include:
  * [Incremental models](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-models-overview) with merge or append strategies
  * [Microbatch incremental strategy](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-microbatch) for large time-series tables
  * Jobs scheduled very frequently (like every 5 minutes)
  * [Dynamic tables](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/snowflake-configs#dynamic-tables) or [materialized views](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/materializations#materialized-view) with short refresh intervals


## Key recommendations[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/1-intro#key-recommendations "Direct link to Key recommendations")
The following are some key recommendations to help you achieve near real-time data freshness with dbt:
  * Ingest data continuously: Use your warehouse's native streaming or micro-batch ingestion to land raw data as soon as it arrives.
  * Transform with dbt on a frequent schedule: Schedule dbt jobs to run as often as your business needs allow (for example, every 1–15 minutes). Balance freshness with cost and resource constraints.
  * Materialized views and dynamic tables: For the lowest-latency reporting, use materialized views or dynamic tables. These can be refreshed as frequently as every minute.
  * Incremental models and microbatching: Use dbt's incremental models to process only new or changed data, keeping transformations efficient and scalable.
  * Decouple ingestion from transformation: Keep data acquisition and transformation flows separate. This allows you to optimize each independently.
  * Monitor and test data freshness: Implement data quality checks and freshness monitoring to ensure your near real-time pipelines deliver accurate, up-to-date results.
  * Cost and complexity considerations: Running dbt jobs more frequently drives up compute costs and operational complexity. Always weigh the business value against these trade-offs.

Your Databricks dbt project should be configured after following the ["How to set up your databricks dbt project guide"](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/set-up-your-databricks-dbt-project). Now we’re ready to start building a dbt project using Unity Catalog. However, we should first consider how we want to allow dbt users to interact with our different catalogs. We recommend the following best practices to ensure the integrity of your production data:
## Isolate your Bronze (aka source) data[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/dbt-unity-catalog-best-practices#isolate-your-bronze-aka-source-data "Direct link to Isolate your Bronze \(aka source\) data")
We recommend using Unity Catalog because it allows you to reference data across your organization from any other catalog, legacy Hive metastore, external metastore, or Delta Live Table pipeline outputs. Additionally, Databricks offers the capability to [interact with external data](https://docs.databricks.com/external-data/index.html#interact-with-external-data-on-databricks) and supports query federation to many [database solutions](https://docs.databricks.com/query-federation/index.html#what-is-query-federation-for-databricks-sql). This means your dev and prod environments will have access to your source data, even if it is defined in another catalog or external data source.
Raw data in your Bronze layer should be defined as dbt [sources](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/sources) and should be read-only for all dbt interactions in both development and production. By default, we recommend that all of these inputs should be accessible by all dbt users in all dbt environments. This ensures that transformations in all environments begin with the same input data, and the results observed in development will be replicated when that code is deployed. That being said, there are times when your company’s data governance requirements necessitate using multiple workspaces or data catalogs depending on the environment.
If you have different data catalogs/schemas for your source data depending on your environment, you can use the [target.name](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/target#use-targetname-to-change-your-source-database) to change the data catalog/schema you’re pulling from depending on the environment.
If you use multiple Databricks workspaces to isolate development from production, you can use dbt’s [environment variables](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/environment-variables) in your connection config strings to reference multiple workspaces from one dbt project. You can also do the same thing for your SQL warehouse so you can have different sizes based on your environments.
To do so, use dbt's [environment variable syntax](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/environment-variables#special-environment-variables) for Server Hostname of your Databricks workspace URL and HTTP Path for the SQL warehouse in your connection settings. Note that Server Hostname still needs to appear to be a valid domain name to pass validation checks, so you will need to hard-code the domain suffix on the URL, eg `{{env_var('DBT_HOSTNAME')}}.cloud.databricks.com` and the path prefix for your warehouses, eg `/sql/1.0/warehouses/{{env_var('DBT_HTTP_PATH')}}`.
Using environment variable syntax in connection configs
When you create environments in dbt, you can assign environment variables to populate the connection information dynamically. Don’t forget to make sure the tokens you use in the credentials for those environments were generated from the associated workspace.
Defining default environment variable values
## Access Control[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/dbt-unity-catalog-best-practices#access-control "Direct link to Access Control")
For granting access to data consumers, use dbt’s [grants config](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/grants) to apply permissions to database objects generated by dbt models. This lets you configure grants as a structured dictionary rather than writing all the SQL yourself and lets dbt take the most efficient path to apply those grants.
As for permissions to run dbt and read non-consumer-facing data sources, the table below summarizes an access model. Effectively, all developers should get no more than read access on the prod catalog and write access in the dev catalog. When using dbt, schema creation is taken care of for you; unlike traditional data warehousing workflows, you do not need to manually create any Unity Catalog assets other than the top-level catalogs.
The **prod** service principal should have “read” access to raw source data, and “write” access to the prod catalog. If you add a **test** catalog and associated dbt environment, you should create a dedicated service principal. The test service principal should have _read_ on raw source data, and _write_ on the **test** catalog but no permissions on the prod or dev catalogs. A dedicated test environment should be used for [CI testing](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/adopting-ci-cd-with-dbt-cloud/) only.
**Table-level grants:**
Source Data | Development catalog | Production catalog | Test catalog
---|---|---|---
developers | select | select & modify | select or none | none
production service principal | select | none | select & modify | none
Test service principal | select | none | none | select & modify
Loading table...
---
**Schema-level grants:**
Source Data | Development catalog | Production catalog | Test catalog
---|---|---|---
developers | use | use, create schema, table, & view | use or none | none
production service principal | use | none | use, create schema, table & view | none
Test service principal | use | none | none | use, create schema, table & view

## Why does style matter?[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/0-how-we-style-our-dbt-projects?version=1.12#why-does-style-matter "Direct link to Why does style matter?")
Style might seem like a trivial, surface-level issue, but it's a deeply material aspect of a well-built project. A consistent, clear style enhances readability and makes your project easier to understand and maintain. Highly readable code helps build clear mental models making it easier to debug and extend your project. It's not just a favor to yourself, though; equally importantly, it makes it less effort for others to understand and contribute to your project, which is essential for peer collaboration, open-source work, and onboarding new team members. [A style guide lets you focus on what matters](https://mtlynch.io/human-code-reviews-1/#settle-style-arguments-with-a-style-guide), the logic and impact of your project, rather than the superficialities of how it's written. This brings harmony and pace to your team's work, and makes reviews more enjoyable and valuable.
## What's important about style?[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/0-how-we-style-our-dbt-projects?version=1.12#whats-important-about-style "Direct link to What's important about style?")
There are two crucial tenets of code style:
  * Clarity
  * Consistency


Style your code in such a way that you can quickly read and understand it. It's also important to consider code review and git diffs. If you're making a change to a model, you want reviewers to see just the material changes you're making clearly.
Once you've established a clear style, stay consistent. This is the most important thing. Everybody on your team needs to have a unified style, which is why having a style guide is so crucial. If you're writing a model, you should be able to look at other models in the project that your teammates have written and read in the same style. If you're writing a macro or a test, you should see the same style as your models. Consistency is key.
## How should I style?[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/0-how-we-style-our-dbt-projects?version=1.12#how-should-i-style "Direct link to How should I style?")
You should style the project in a way you and your teammates or collaborators agree on. The most important thing is that you have a style guide and stick to it. This guide is just a suggestion to get you started and to give you a sense of what a style guide might look like. It covers various areas you may want to consider, with suggested rules. It emphasizes lots of whitespace, clarity, clear naming, and comments.
We believe one of the strengths of SQL is that it reads like English, so we lean into that declarative nature throughout our projects. Even within dbt Labs, though, there are differing opinions on how to style, even a small but passionate contingent of leading comma enthusiasts! Again, the important thing is not to follow this style guide; it's to make _your_ style guide and follow it. Lastly, be sure to include rules, tools, _and_ examples in your style guide to make it as easy as possible for your team to follow.
## Automation[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/0-how-we-style-our-dbt-projects?version=1.12#automation "Direct link to Automation")
Use formatters and linters as much as possible. We're all human, we make mistakes. Not only that, but we all have different preferences and opinions while writing code. Automation is a great way to ensure that your project is styled consistently and correctly and that people can write in a way that's quick and comfortable for them, while still getting perfectly consistent output.

## What is dbt Mesh?[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-1-intro?version=1.12#what-is-dbt-mesh "Direct link to What is dbt Mesh?")
Organizations of all sizes rely upon dbt to manage their data transformations, from small startups to large enterprises. At scale, it can be challenging to coordinate all the organizational and technical requirements demanded by your stakeholders within the scope of a single dbt project.
To date, there also hasn't been a first-class way to effectively manage the dependencies, governance, and workflows between multiple dbt projects.
That's where **Mesh** comes in - empowering data teams to work _independently and collaboratively_ ; sharing data, code, and best practices without sacrificing security or autonomy.
Mesh is not a single product - it is a pattern enabled by a convergence of several features in dbt:
  * **[Cross-project references](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/project-dependencies#how-to-write-cross-project-ref)** - this is the foundational feature that enables the multi-project deployments. `{{ ref() }}`s now work across dbt projects on Enterprise and Enterprise+ plans.
  * - dbt's metadata-powered documentation platform, complete with full, cross-project lineage.
  * **Governance** - dbt's governance features allow you to manage access to your dbt models both within and across projects.
    * - With groups, you can organize nodes in your dbt DAG that share a logical connection (for example, by functional area) and assign an owner to the entire group.
    * - access configs allow you to control who can reference models.
    * - when coordinating across projects and teams, we recommend treating your data models as stable APIs. Model versioning is the mechanism to allow graceful adoption and deprecation of models as they evolve.
    * - data contracts set explicit expectations on the shape of the data to ensure data changes upstream of dbt or within a project's logic don't break downstream consumers' data products.


## When is the right time to use dbt Mesh?[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-1-intro?version=1.12#when-is-the-right-time-to-use-dbt-mesh "Direct link to When is the right time to use dbt Mesh?")
The multi-project architecture helps organizations with mature, complex transformation workflows in dbt increase the flexibility and performance of their dbt projects. If you're already using dbt and your project has started to experience any of the following, you're likely ready to start exploring this paradigm:
  * The **number of models** in your project is degrading performance and slowing down development.
  * Teams have developed **separate workflows** and need to decouple development from each other.
  * Teams are experiencing **communication challenges** , and the reliability of some of your data products has started to deteriorate.
  * **Security and governance** requirements are increasing and would benefit from increased isolation.


dbt is designed to coordinate the features above and simplify the complexity to solve for these problems.
If you're just starting your dbt journey, don't worry about building a multi-project architecture right away. You can _incrementally_ adopt the features in this guide as you scale. The collection of features work effectively as independent tools. Familiarizing yourself with the tooling and features that make up a multi-project architecture, and how they can apply to your organization will help you make better decisions as you grow.
For additional information, refer to the [Mesh FAQs](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-5-faqs).
## Learning goals[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-1-intro?version=1.12#learning-goals "Direct link to Learning goals")
  * Understand the **purpose and tradeoffs** of building a multi-project architecture.
  * Develop an intuition for various **Mesh patterns** and how to design a multi-project architecture for your organization.
  * Establish recommended steps to **incrementally adopt** these patterns in your dbt implementation.

On this page
Before you begin, you must be aware of a few conditions:
  * `dbt clone` is only available with dbt version 1.6 and newer. Refer to our [upgrade guide](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/upgrade-dbt-version-in-cloud) for help enabling newer versions in dbt.
  * This strategy only works for warehouse that support zero copy cloning (otherwise `dbt clone` will just create pointer views).
  * Some teams may want to test that their incremental models run in both incremental mode and full-refresh mode.


Imagine you've created a [Slim CI job](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/continuous-integration) in dbt and it is configured to:
  * Defer to your production environment.
  * Run the command `dbt build --select state:modified+` to run and test all of the models you've modified and their downstream dependencies.
  * Trigger whenever a developer on your team opens a PR against the main branch.


Example of a slim CI job with the above configurations
Now imagine your dbt project looks something like this in the DAG:
Sample project DAG
When you open a pull request (PR) that modifies `dim_wizards`, your CI job will kickoff and build _only the modified models and their downstream dependencies_ (in this case, `dim_wizards` and `fct_orders`) into a temporary schema that's unique to your PR.
This build mimics the behavior of what will happen once the PR is merged into the main branch. It ensures you're not introducing breaking changes, without needing to build your entire dbt project.
## What happens when one of the modified models (or one of their downstream dependencies) is an incremental model?[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/clone-incremental-models#what-happens-when-one-of-the-modified-models-or-one-of-their-downstream-dependencies-is-an-incremental-model "Direct link to What happens when one of the modified models \(or one of their downstream dependencies\) is an incremental model?")
Because your CI job is building modified models into a PR-specific schema, on the first execution of `dbt build --select state:modified+`, the modified incremental model will be built in its entirety _because it does not yet exist in the PR-specific schema_ and [is_incremental will be false](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-models#understand-the-is_incremental-macro). You're running in `full-refresh` mode.
This can be suboptimal because:
  * Typically incremental models are your largest datasets, so they take a long time to build in their entirety which can slow down development time and incur high warehouse costs.
  * There are situations where a `full-refresh` of the incremental model passes successfully in your CI job but an _incremental_ build of that same table in prod would fail when the PR is merged into main (think schema drift where [on_schema_change](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-models#what-if-the-columns-of-my-incremental-model-change) config is set to `fail`)


You can alleviate these problems by zero copy cloning the relevant, pre-existing incremental models into your PR-specific schema as the first step of the CI job using the `dbt clone` command. This way, the incremental models already exist in the PR-specific schema when you first execute the command `dbt build --select state:modified+` so the `is_incremental` flag will be `true`.
You'll have two commands for your dbt CI check to execute:
  1. Clone all of the pre-existing incremental models that have been modified or are downstream of another model that has been modified:


```
dbt clone --select state:modified+,config.materialized:incremental,state:old
```

  1. Build all of the models that have been modified and their downstream dependencies:


```
dbt build --select state:modified+
```

Because of your first clone step, the incremental models selected in your `dbt build` on the second step will run in incremental mode.
Clone command in the CI config
Your CI jobs will run faster, and you're more accurately mimicking the behavior of what will happen once the PR has been merged into main.
### Expansion on "think schema drift" where [on_schema_change](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-models#what-if-the-columns-of-my-incremental-model-change) config is set to `fail`" from above[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/clone-incremental-models#expansion-on-think-schema-drift-where-on_schema_change-config-is-set-to-fail-from-above "Direct link to expansion-on-think-schema-drift-where-on_schema_change-config-is-set-to-fail-from-above")
Imagine you have an incremental model `my_incremental_model` with the following config:
```
    config(        materialized='incremental',        unique_key='unique_id',        on_schema_change='fail'
```

Now, let’s say you open up a PR that adds a new column to `my_incremental_model`. In this case:
  * An incremental build will fail.
  * A `full-refresh` will succeed.


If you have a daily production job that just executes `dbt build` without a `--full-refresh` flag, once the PR is merged into main and the job kicks off, you will get a failure. So the question is - what do you want to happen in CI?
  * Do you want to also get a failure in CI, so that you know that once this PR is merged into main you need to immediately execute a `dbt build --full-refresh --select my_incremental_model` in production in order to avoid a failure in prod? This will block your CI check from passing.
  * Do you want your CI check to succeed, because once you do run a `full-refresh` for this model in prod you will be in a successful state? This may lead unpleasant surprises if your production job is suddenly failing when you merge this PR into main if you don’t remember you need to execute a `dbt build --full-refresh --select my_incremental_model` in production.


There’s probably no perfect solution here; it’s all just tradeoffs! Our preference would be to have the failing CI job and have to manually override the blocking branch protection rule so that there are no surprises and we can proactively run the appropriate command in production once the PR is merged.
### Expansion on "why `state:old`"[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/clone-incremental-models#expansion-on-why-stateold "Direct link to expansion-on-why-stateold")
For brand new incremental models, you want them to run in `full-refresh` mode in CI, because they will run in `full-refresh` mode in production when the PR is merged into `main`. They also don't exist yet in the production environment... they're brand new! If you don't specify this, you won't get an error just a “No relation found in state manifest for…”. So, it technically works without specifying `state:old` but adding `state:old` is more explicit and means it won't even try to clone the brand new incremental models.

**Don't Nest Your Curlies**

### Jinja[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/dont-nest-your-curlies?version=1.12#jinja "Direct link to Jinja")
When writing Jinja code in a dbt project, it may be tempting to nest expressions inside of each other. Take this example:
```
  {{ dbt_utils.date_spine(      datepart="day",      start_date=[ USE JINJA HERE ]
```

To nest a Jinja expression inside of another Jinja expression, simply place the desired code (without curly brackets) directly into the expression.
**Correct example** Here, the return value of the `var()` context method is supplied as the `start_date` argument to the `date_spine` macro. Great!
```
  {{ dbt_utils.date_spine(      datepart="day",      start_date=var('start_date')
```

**Incorrect example** Once we've denoted that we're inside a Jinja expression (using the `{{` syntax), no further curly brackets are required inside of the Jinja expression. This code will supply a literal string value, `"{{ var('start_date') }}"`, as the `start_date` argument to the `date_spine` macro. This is probably not what you actually want to do!
```
-- Do not do this! It will not work!  {{ dbt_utils.date_spine(      datepart="day",      start_date="{{ var('start_date') }}"
```

Here's another example:
```
{# Either of these work #}{%set query_sql ='select * from '~ ref('my_model')%}{%set query_sql %}select*from {{ ref('my_model') }}{% endset %}{# This does not #}{%set query_sql ="select * from {{ ref('my_model')}}"%}
```

### An exception[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/dont-nest-your-curlies?version=1.12#an-exception "Direct link to An exception")
There is one exception to this rule: curlies inside of curlies are acceptable in hooks (ie. `on-run-start`, `on-run-end`, `pre-hook`, and `post-hook`).
Code like this is both valid, and encouraged:
```
{{ config(post_hook="grant select on {{ this }} to role bi_role") }}
```

So why are curlies inside of curlies allowed in this case? Here, we actually _want_ the string literal `"grant select on {{ this }} ..."` to be saved as the configuration value for the post-hook in this model. This string will be re-rendered when the model runs, resulting in a sensible SQL expression like `grant select on "schema"."table"....` being executed against the database. These hooks are a special exception to the rule stated above.

On this page
What _really_ happens when you type `dbt build`? Contrary to popular belief, a crack team of microscopic data elves do _not_ construct your data row by row, although the truth feels equally magical. This guide explores the real answer to that question, with an introductory look at the objects that get built into your warehouse, why they matter, and how dbt knows what to build.
For video tutorials on Snapshots, go to dbt Learn and check out the [Snapshots course](https://learn.getdbt.com/courses/snapshots).
The configurations that tell dbt how to construct these objects are called _materializations,_ and knowing how to use them is a crucial skill for effective analytics engineering. When you’ve completed this guide, you will have that ability to use the three core materializations that cover most common analytics engineering situations.
😌 **Materializations abstract away DDL and DML**. Typically in raw SQL- or python-based [data transformation](https://www.getdbt.com/analytics-engineering/transformation/), you have to write specific imperative instructions on how to build or modify your data objects. dbt’s materializations make this declarative, we tell dbt how we want things to be constructed and it figures out how to do that given the unique conditions and qualities of our warehouse.
### Learning goals[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/materializations/1-guide-overview?version=1.12#learning-goals "Direct link to Learning goals")
By the end of this guide you should have a solid understanding of:
  * 🛠️ what **materializations** are
  * 👨‍👨‍👧 how the three main materializations that ship with dbt — **table** , **view** , and **incremental** — differ
  * 🗺️ **when** and **where** to use specific materializations to optimize your development and production builds
  * ⚙️ how to **configure materializations** at various scopes, from an individual model to entire folder


### Prerequisites[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/materializations/1-guide-overview?version=1.12#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")
  * 📒 You’ll want to have worked through the [quickstart guide](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides) and have a project setup to work through these concepts.
  * 🏃🏻‍♀️ Concepts like dbt runs, `ref()` statements, and models should be familiar to you.
  * 🔧 [**Optional**] Reading through the [How we structure our dbt projects](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview) Guide will be beneficial for the last section of this guide, when we review best practices for materializations using the dbt project approach of staging models and marts.


### Guiding principle[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/materializations/1-guide-overview?version=1.12#guiding-principle "Direct link to Guiding principle")
We’ll explore this in-depth throughout, but the basic guideline is **start as simple as possible**. We’ll follow a tiered approached, only moving up a tier when it’s necessary.
  * 🔍 **Start with a view.** When the view gets too long to _query_ for end users,
  * ⚒️ **Make it a table.** When the table gets too long to _build_ in your dbt Jobs,
  * 📚 **Build it incrementally.** That is, layer the data on in chunks as it comes in.

## Why does structure matter?[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview?version=1.12#why-does-structure-matter "Direct link to Why does structure matter?")
Analytics engineering, at its core, is about helping groups of human beings collaborate on better decisions at scale. We have [limited bandwidth for making decisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue). We also, as a cooperative social species, rely on [systems and patterns to optimize collaboration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language) with others. This combination of traits means that for collaborative projects it's crucial to establish consistent and comprehensible norms such that your team’s limited bandwidth for decision making can be spent on unique and difficult problems, not deciding where folders should go or how to name files.
Building a great dbt project is an inherently collaborative endeavor, bringing together domain knowledge from every department to map the goals and narratives of the entire company. As such, it's especially important to establish a deep and broad set of patterns to ensure as many people as possible are empowered to leverage their particular expertise in a positive way, and to ensure that the project remains approachable and maintainable as your organization scales.
Famously, Steve Jobs [wore the same outfit everyday](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5453c539e4b02ab5398ffc8f/1580381503218-E56FQDNFL1P4OBLQWHWW/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kJKedFpub2aPqa33K4gNUDwUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYxCRW4BPu10St3TBAUQYVKcxb5ZTIyC_D49_DDQq2Sj8YVGtM7O1i4h5tvKa2lazN4nGUQWMS_WcPM-ztWbVr-c/steve_jobs_outfit.jpg) to reduce decision fatigue. You can think of this guide similarly, as a black turtleneck and New Balance sneakers for your company’s dbt project. A dbt project’s power outfit, or more accurately its structure, is composed not of fabric but of files, folders, naming conventions, and programming patterns. How you label things, group them, split them up, or bring them together — the system you use to organize the [data transformations](https://www.getdbt.com/analytics-engineering/transformation/) encoded in your dbt project — this is your project’s structure.
This guide is just a starting point. You may decide that you prefer Birkenstocks or a purple hoodie for your project over Jobs-ian minimalism. That's fine. What's important is that you think through the reasoning for those changes in your organization, explicitly declare them in a thorough, accessible way for all contributors, and above all _stay consistent_.
One foundational principle that applies to all dbt projects though, is the need to establish a cohesive arc moving data from _source-conformed_ to _business-conformed_. Source-conformed data is shaped by external systems out of our control, while business-conformed data is shaped by the needs, concepts, and definitions we create. No matter what patterns or conventions you define within your project, this process remains the essential purpose of the transformation layer, and dbt as your tool within it. This guide is an update to a seminal analytics engineering [post of the same name](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/how-we-structure-our-dbt-projects/355) by the great Claire Carroll, and while some of the details have changed over time (as anticipated in that post) this fundamental trajectory holds true. Moving forward, this guide will be iteratively updated as new tools expand our viewpoints, new experiences sharpen our vision, and new voices strengthen our perspectives, but always in service of that aim.
### Learning goals[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview?version=1.12#learning-goals "Direct link to Learning goals")
This guide has three main goals:
  * Thoroughly cover our most up-to-date recommendations on how to structure typical dbt projects
  * Illustrate these recommendations with comprehensive examples
  * At each stage, explain _why_ we recommend the approach that we do, so that you're equipped to decide when and where to deviate from these recommendations to better fit your organization’s unique needs


You should walk away from this guide with a deeper mental model of how the components of a dbt project fit together, such that purpose and principles of analytics engineering feel more clear and intuitive.
By approaching our structure intentionally, we’ll gain a better understanding of foundational ideals like moving our data from the wide array of narrower source-conformed models that our systems give us to a narrower set of wider, richer business-conformed designs we create. As we move along that arc, we’ll understand how stacking our transformations in optimized, modular layers means we can apply each transformation in only one place. With a disciplined approach to the files, folders, and materializations that comprise our structure, we’ll find that we can create clear stories not only through our data, but also our codebase and the artifacts it generates in our warehouse.
Our hope is that by deepening your sense of the connections between these patterns and the principles they flow from, you'll be able to translate them to fit your specific needs and craft customized documentation for your team to act on.
This guide walks through our recommendations using a very simple dbt project — similar to the one used for the Getting Started guide and many other demos — from a fictional company called the Jaffle Shop. You can read more about [jaffles](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/jaffle) if you want (they _are_ a real thing), but that context isn’t important to understand the structure. We encourage you to follow along, try things out, make changes, and take notes on what works or doesn't work for you along the way.
We'll get a deeper sense of our project as we move through the guide, but for now we just need to know that the Jaffle Shop is a restaurant selling jaffles that has two main data sources:
  * A replica of our transactional database, called `jaffle_shop`, with core entities like orders and customers.
  * Synced data from [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), which we use for processing payments.


### Guide structure overview[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview?version=1.12#guide-structure-overview "Direct link to Guide structure overview")
We'll walk through our topics in the same order that our data would move through transformation:
  1. Dig into how we structure the files, folders, and models for our three primary layers in the `models` directory, which build on each other:
    1. **Staging** — creating our atoms, our initial modular building blocks, from source data
    2. **Intermediate** — stacking layers of logic with clear and specific purposes to prepare our staging models to join into the entities we want
    3. **Marts** — bringing together our modular pieces into a wide, rich vision of the entities our organization cares about
  2. Explore how these layers fit into the rest of the project:
    1. Review the overall structure comprehensively
    2. Expand on YAML configuration in-depth
    3. Discuss how to use the other folders in a dbt project: `tests`, `seeds`, and `analyses`


Below is the complete file tree of the project we’ll be working through. Don’t worry if this looks like a lot of information to take in at once - this is just to give you the full vision of what we’re building towards. We’ll focus in on each of the sections one by one as we break down the project’s structure.

**Don't Nest Your Curlies**
> If dbt errors out early
> and your Jinja is making you surly
> don't post to the slack
> just take a step back
> and check if you're nesting your curlies.
### Jinja[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/dont-nest-your-curlies?version=1.12#jinja "Direct link to Jinja")
When writing Jinja code in a dbt project, it may be tempting to nest expressions inside of each other. Take this example:
```
  {{ dbt_utils.date_spine(      datepart="day",      start_date=[ USE JINJA HERE ]
```

To nest a Jinja expression inside of another Jinja expression, simply place the desired code (without curly brackets) directly into the expression.
**Correct example** Here, the return value of the `var()` context method is supplied as the `start_date` argument to the `date_spine` macro. Great!
```
  {{ dbt_utils.date_spine(      datepart="day",      start_date=var('start_date')
```

**Incorrect example** Once we've denoted that we're inside a Jinja expression (using the `{{` syntax), no further curly brackets are required inside of the Jinja expression. This code will supply a literal string value, `"{{ var('start_date') }}"`, as the `start_date` argument to the `date_spine` macro. This is probably not what you actually want to do!
```
-- Do not do this! It will not work!  {{ dbt_utils.date_spine(      datepart="day",      start_date="{{ var('start_date') }}"
```

Here's another example:
```
{# Either of these work #}{%set query_sql ='select * from '~ ref('my_model')%}{%set query_sql %}select*from {{ ref('my_model') }}{% endset %}{# This does not #}{%set query_sql ="select * from {{ ref('my_model')}}"%}
```

### An exception[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/dont-nest-your-curlies?version=1.12#an-exception "Direct link to An exception")
There is one exception to this rule: curlies inside of curlies are acceptable in hooks (ie. `on-run-start`, `on-run-end`, `pre-hook`, and `post-hook`).
Code like this is both valid, and encouraged:
```
{{ config(post_hook="grant select on {{ this }} to role bi_role") }}
```

So why are curlies inside of curlies allowed in this case? Here, we actually _want_ the string literal `"grant select on {{ this }} ..."` to be saved as the configuration value for the post-hook in this model. This string will be re-rendered when the model runs, resulting in a sensible SQL expression like `grant select on "schema"."table"....` being executed against the database. These hooks are a special exception to the rule stated above.

## Exploring mesh patterns[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-3-structures#exploring-mesh-patterns "Direct link to Exploring mesh patterns")
When adopting a multi-project architecture, where do you draw the lines between projects?
How should you organize data workflows in a world where instead of having a single dbt DAG, you have multiple projects speaking to each other, each comprised of their own DAG?
Adopting the Mesh pattern is not a one-size-fits-all process. In fact, it's the opposite! It's about customizing your project structure to fit _your_ team and _your_ data. Now you can mold your organizational knowledge graph to your organizational people graph, bringing people and data closer together rather than compromising one for the other.
While there is not a single best way to implement this pattern, there are some common decision points that will be helpful for you to consider.
At a high level, you’ll need to decide:
  * Where to draw the lines between your dbt Projects -- i.e. how do you determine where to split your DAG and which models go in which project?
  * How to manage your code -- do you want multiple dbt Projects living in the same repository (mono-repo) or do you want to have multiple repos with one repo per project?


To help you get started, check out our [Quickstart with Mesh](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/mesh-qs) or our online [Mesh course](https://learn.getdbt.com/courses/dbt-mesh) to learn more!
## Define your project interfaces by splitting your DAG[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-3-structures#define-your-project-interfaces-by-splitting-your-dag "Direct link to Define your project interfaces by splitting your DAG")
The first (and perhaps most difficult!) decision when migrating to a multi-project architecture is deciding where to draw the line in your DAG to define the interfaces between your projects. Let's explore some language for discussing the design of these patterns.
### Vertical splits[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-3-structures#vertical-splits "Direct link to Vertical splits")
Vertical splits separate out layers of transformation in DAG order. Let's look at some examples.
  * **Splitting up staging and mart layers** to create a more tightly-controlled, shared set of components that other projects build on but can't edit.
  * **Isolating earlier models for security and governance requirements** to separate out and mask PII data so that downstream consumers can't access it is a common use case for a vertical split.
  * **Protecting complex or expensive data** to isolate large or complex models that are expensive to run so that they are safe from accidental selection, independently deployable, and easier to debug when they have issues.

### Horizontal splits[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-3-structures#horizontal-splits "Direct link to Horizontal splits")
Horizontal splits separate your DAG based on source or domain. These splits are often based around the shape and size of the data and how it's used. Let's consider some possibilities for horizontal splitting.
  * **Team consumption patterns.** For example, splitting out the marketing team's data flow into a separate project.
  * **Data from different sources.** For example, clickstream event data and transactional ecommerce data may need to be modeled independently of each other.
  * **Team workflows.** For example, if two embedded groups operate at different paces, you may want to split the projects up so they can move independently.

### Combining these strategies[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-3-structures#combining-these-strategies "Direct link to Combining these strategies")
  * **These are not either/or techniques**. You should consider both types of splits, and combine them in any way that makes sense for your organization.
  * **Pick one type of split and focus on that first**. If you have a hub-and-spoke team topology for example, handle breaking out the central platform project before you split the remainder into domains. Then if you need to break those domains up horizontally you can focus on that after the fact.
  * **DRY applies to underlying data, not just code.** Regardless of your strategy, you should not be sourcing the same rows and columns into multiple nodes. When working within a mesh pattern it becomes increasingly important that we don't duplicate logic or data.

## Determine your git strategy[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-3-structures#determine-your-git-strategy "Direct link to Determine your git strategy")
A multi-project architecture can exist in a single repo (monorepo) or as multiple projects, with each one being in their own repository (multi-repo).
  * If you're a **smaller team** looking primarily to speed up and simplify development, a **monorepo** is likely the right choice, but can become unwieldy as the number of projects, models and contributors grow.
  * If you’re a **larger team with multiple groups** , and need to decouple projects for security and enablement of different development styles and rhythms, a **multi-repo setup** is your best bet.


## Projects, splits, and teams[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-3-structures#projects-splits-and-teams "Direct link to Projects, splits, and teams")
Since the launch of Mesh, the most common pattern we've seen is one where projects are 1:1 aligned to teams, and each project has its own codebase in its own repository. This isn’t a hard-and-fast rule: Some organizations want multiple teams working out of a single repo, and some teams own multiple domains that feel awkward to keep combined.
Users may need to contribute models across multiple projects and this is fine. There will be some friction doing this, versus a single repo, but this is _useful_ friction, especially if upstreaming a change from a “spoke” to a “hub.” This should be treated like making an API change, one that the other team will be living with for some time to come. You should be concerned if your teammates find they need to make a coordinated change across multiple projects very frequently (every week), or as a key prerequisite for ~20%+ of their work.
### Cycle detection[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-3-structures#cycle-detection "Direct link to Cycle detection")
You can enable bidirectional dependencies across projects so these relationships can go in either direction, meaning that the `jaffle_finance` project can add a new model that depends on any public models produced by the `jaffle_marketing` project, so long as the new dependency doesn't introduce any node-level cycles. dbt checks for cycles across projects and raises errors if any are detected.
When setting up projects that depend on each other, it's important to do so in a stepwise fashion. Each project must run and produce public models before the original producer project can take a dependency on the original consumer project. For example, the order of operations would be as follows for a simple two-project setup:
  1. The `project_a` project runs in a deployment environment and produces public models.
  2. The `project_b` project adds `project_a` as a dependency.
  3. The `project_b` project runs in a deployment environment and produces public models.
  4. The `project_a` project adds `project_b` as a dependency.


### Tips and tricks[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-3-structures#tips-and-tricks "Direct link to Tips and tricks")
The [implementation](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-4-implementation) page provides more in-depth examples of how to split a monolithic project into multiple projects. Here are some tips to get you started when considering the splitting methods listed above on your own projects:
  1. Start by drawing a diagram of your teams doing data work. Map each team to a single dbt project. If you already have an existing monolithic project, and you’re onboarding _net-new teams,_ this could be as simple as declaring the existing project as your “hub” and creating new “spoke” sandbox projects for each team.
  2. Split off common foundations when you know that multiple downstream teams will require the same data source. Those could be upstreamed into a centralized hub or split off into a separate foundational project. need some splits to facilitate other splits, for example, source staging models in A that are used in both B and C (lack of project cycles).
  3. Split again to introduce intentional friction and encapsulate a particular set of models (for example, for external export).
  4. Recombine if you have “hot path” subsets of the DAG that you need to deploy with low latency because it powers in-app reporting or operational analytics. It might make sense to have a different dedicated team own these data models (see principle 1), similar to how software services with significantly different performance characteristics often warrant dedicated infrastructure, architecture, and staffing.

The rest of this guide will focus on the process of migrating your existing dbt code to the Semantic Layer. To do this, we'll need to introduce some new terminology and concepts that are specific to the Semantic Layer.
We want to define them up front, as we have specific meanings in mind applicable to the process of migrating code to the Semantic Layer. These terms can mean different things in different settings, but here we mean:
  * 🔲 **Normalized** — can be defined with varying degrees of technical rigor, but used here we mean something that contains unique data stored only once in one place, so it can be efficiently joined and aggregated into various shapes. You can think of it referring to tables that function as conceptual building blocks in your business, _not_ in the sense of say, strict [Codd 3NF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_normal_form).
  * 🛒 **Mart** — also has a variety of definitions, but here we mean a table that is relatively normalized and functions as the source of truth for a core concept in your business.
  * 🕸️ **Denormalized** — when we store the same data in multiple places for easier access without joins. The most denormalized data modeling system is OBT (One Big Table), where we try to get every possible interesting column related to a concept (for instance, customers) into one big table so all an analyst needs to do is `select`.
  * 🗞️ **Rollup** — used here as a catchall term meaning both denormalized tables built on top of normalized marts and those that perform aggregations to a certain grain. For example `active_accounts_per_week` might aggregate `customers` and `orders` data to a weekly time. Another example would be `customer_metrics` which might denormalize a lot of the data from `customers` as well as aggregated data from `orders`. For the sake of brevity in this guide, we’ll call all these types of products built on top of your normalized concepts as **rollups**.


We'll also use a couple _new_ terms for the sake of brevity. These aren't standard or official dbt-isms, but useful for communicating meaning in the context of refactoring code for the Semantic Layer:
  * 🧊 **Frozen** — shorthand to indicate code that is statically built in dbt’s logical transformation layer. Does not refer to the materialization type: views, incremental models, and regular tables are all considered _frozen_ as they statically generate data or code that is stored in the warehouse as opposed to dynamically querying, as with the Semantic Layer. This is _not_ a bad thing! We want some portion of our transformation logic to be frozen and stable as the _transformation_ _logic_ is not rapidly shifting and we benefit in testing, performance, and stability.
  * 🫠 **Melting** — the process of breaking up frozen structures into flexible Semantic Layer code. This allows them to create as many combinations and aggregations as possible dynamically in response to stakeholder needs and queries.


🏎️ **The Semantic Layer is a denormalization engine.** dbt transforms your data into clean, normalized marts. The Semantic Layer is a denormalization engine that dynamically connects and molds these building blocks into the maximum amount of shapes available _dynamically_.

## A new approach[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-8-refactor-a-rollup#a-new-approach "Direct link to A new approach")
Now that we've set the stage, it's time to dig in to the fun and messy part: how do we refactor an existing rollup in dbt into semantic models and metrics?
Let's look at the differences we can observe in how we might approach this with MetricFlow supercharging dbt versus how we work without a Semantic Layer. These differences can then inform our structure.
  * 🍊 In dbt, we tend to create **highly denormalized datasets** that bring **everything you want around a certain entity or process into a single table**.
  * 💜 The problem is, this **limits the dimensionality available to MetricFlow**. The more we pre-compute and 'freeze' into place, the less flexible our data is.
  * 🚰 In MetricFlow, we ideally want **highly normalized** , star schema-like data that then allows MetricFlow to shine as a **denormalization engine**.
  * ∞ Another way to think about this is that instead of moving down a list of requested priorities trying to pre-make as many combinations of our marts as possible — increasing lines of code and complexity — we can **let MetricFlow present every combination possible without specifically coding it**.
  * 🏗️ To resolve these approaches optimally, we'll need to shift some **fundamental aspects of our modeling strategy**.


## Refactor steps outlined[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-8-refactor-a-rollup#refactor-steps-outlined "Direct link to Refactor steps outlined")
We recommend an incremental implementation process that looks something like this:
  1. 👉 Identify **an important output** (a revenue chart on a dashboard for example, and the mart model(s) that supplies this output.
  2. 🔍 Examine all the **entities that are components** of this rollup (for instance, an `active_customers_per_week` rollup may include customers, shipping, and product data).
  3. 🛠️ **Build semantic models** for all the underlying component marts.
  4. 📏 **Build metrics** for the required aggregations in the rollup.
  5. 👯 Create a **clone of the output** on top of the Semantic Layer.
  6. 💻 Audit to **ensure you get accurate outputs**.
  7. 👉 Identify **any other outputs** that point to the rollup and **move them to the Semantic Layer**.
  8. ✌️ Put a **deprecation plan** in place for the now extraneous frozen rollup.


You would then **continue this process** on other outputs and marts moving down a list of **priorities**. Each model as you go along will be faster and easier as you'll **reuse many of the same components** that will already have been semantically modeled.
## Let's make a `revenue` metric[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-8-refactor-a-rollup#lets-make-a-revenue-metric "Direct link to lets-make-a-revenue-metric")
So far we've been working in new pointing at a staging model to simplify things as we build new mental models for MetricFlow. In reality, unless you're implementing MetricFlow in a green-field dbt project, you probably are going to have some refactoring to do. So let's get into that in detail.
  1. 📚 Per the above steps, let's say we've identified our target as a revenue rollup that is built on top of `orders` and `order_items`. Now we need to identify all the underlying components, these will be all the 'import' CTEs at the top of these marts. So in the Jaffle Shop project we'd need: `orders`, `order_items`, `products`, `locations`, and `supplies`.
  2. 🗺️ We'll next make semantic models for all of these. Let's walk through a straightforward conversion first with `locations`.
  3. ⛓️ We'll want to first decide if we need to do any joining to get this into the shape we want for our semantic model. The biggest determinants of this are two factors:
     * 📏 Does this semantic model **contain measures**?
     * 🕥 Does this semantic model have a **primary timestamp**?
     * 🫂 If a semantic model **has measures but no timestamp** (for example, supplies in the example project, which has static costs of supplies), you'll likely want to **sacrifice some normalization and join it on to another model** that has a primary timestamp to allow for metric aggregation.
  4. 🔄 If we _don't_ need any joins, we'll just go straight to the staging model for our semantic model's `ref`. Locations does have a `tax_rate` measure, but it also has an `ordered_at` timestamp, so we can go **straight to the staging model** here.
  5. 🥇 We specify our **primary entity** (based on `location_id`), dimensions (one categorical, `location_name`, and one **primary time dimension** `opened_at`), and lastly our measures, in this case just `average_tax_rate`.


models/marts/locations.yml
```

The grain of the table is one row per location.model: ref('stg_locations')entities:-name: locationtype: primaryexpr: location_iddimensions:-name: location_nametype: categorical-name: date_trunc('day', opened_at)type: timetype_params:time_granularity: daymeasures:-name: average_tax_ratedescription: Average tax rate.expr: tax_rateagg: avg
```

## Semantic and logical interaction[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-8-refactor-a-rollup#semantic-and-logical-interaction "Direct link to Semantic and logical interaction")
Now, let's tackle a thornier situation. Products and supplies both have dimensions and measures but no time dimension. Products has a one-to-one relationship with `order_items`, enriching that table, which is itself just a mapping table of products to orders. Additionally, products have a one-to-many relationship with supplies. The high-level ERD looks like the diagram below.
So to calculate, for instance, the cost of ingredients and supplies for a given order, we'll need to do some joining and aggregating, but again we **lack a time dimension for products and supplies**. This is the signal to us that we'll **need to build a logical mart** and point our semantic model at that.
**dbt 🧡 MetricFlow.** This is where integrating your semantic definitions into your dbt project really starts to pay dividends. The interaction between the logical and semantic layers is so dynamic, you either need to house them in one codebase or facilitate a lot of cross-project communication and dependency.
  1. 🎯 Let's aim at, to start, building a table at the `order_items` grain. We can aggregate supply costs up, map over the fields we want from products, such as price, and bring the `ordered_at` timestamp we need over from the orders table. You can see example code, copied below, in `models/marts/order_items.sql`.


models/marts/order_items.sql
```

```

  1. 🏗️ Now we've got a table that looks more like what we want to feed into the Semantic Layer. Next, we'll **build a semantic model on top of this new mart** in `models/marts/order_items.yml`. Again, we'll identify our **entities, then dimensions, then measures**.


models/marts/order_items.yml
```
semantic_models:#The name of the semantic model.-name: order_itemsdefaults:agg_time_dimension: ordered_atdescription:|         Items contatined in each order. The grain of the table is one row per order item.model: ref('order_items')entities:-name: order_itemtype: primaryexpr: order_item_id-name: order_idtype: foreignexpr: order_id-name: producttype: foreignexpr: product_iddimensions:-name: ordered_atexpr: date_trunc('day', ordered_at)type: timetype_params:time_granularity: day-name: is_food_itemtype: categorical-name: is_drink_itemtype: categoricalmeasures:-name: revenuedescription: The revenue generated for each order item.

```

  1. 📏 Finally, Let's **build a simple revenue metric** on top of our semantic model now.


models/marts/order_items.yml
```
metrics:-name: revenuedescription: Sum of the product revenue for each order item. Excludes tax.type: simplelabel: Revenuetype_params:measure: revenue
```

## Checking our work[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-8-refactor-a-rollup#checking-our-work "Direct link to Checking our work")
  * 🔍 We always start our **auditing** with a `dbt parse` to **ensure our code works** before we examine its output.
  * 👯 If we're working there, we'll move to trying out an `dbt sl query` that **replicates the logic of the output** we're trying to refactor.
  * 💸 For our example we want to **audit monthly revenue** , to do that we'd run the query below.


### Example query[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-8-refactor-a-rollup#example-query "Direct link to Example query")
```
dbt sl query --metrics revenue --group-by metric_time__month
```

### Example query results[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-8-refactor-a-rollup#example-query-results "Direct link to Example query results")
```
✔ Success 🦄 - query completed after 1.02 seconds| METRIC_TIME__MONTH   |   REVENUE ||:---------------------|----------:||2016-09-01 00:00:00  |17032.00||2016-10-01 00:00:00  |20684.00||2016-11-01 00:00:00  |26338.00||2016-12-01 00:00:00  |10685.00|
```

  * Try introducing some other dimensions from the semantic models into the `group-by` arguments to get a feel for this command.

Teams that implement very high-frequency dbt jobs tend to run into a consistent set of challenges, both at the dbt scheduler layer and in the warehouse itself.
Near real-time service level agreements (SLAs) require premium resources and add significant operational overhead. Pressure-test whether the business really needs minute-level freshness before committing.
## Over-scheduled jobs and queue management[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/6-operational-considerations?version=1.12#over-scheduled-jobs-and-queue-management "Direct link to Over-scheduled jobs and queue management")
If a job's run duration is longer than its schedule frequency, the job becomes over-scheduled. The queue grows faster than the scheduler can process runs, and dbt platform will start cancelling queued runs to avoid an ever-expanding backlog.
This is easy to hit with near real-time patterns if your incremental build time creeps up (more models, more tests, more data) but the cron schedule stays aggressive (for example, every 2–5 minutes).
**Example scenario:**
  * Your job is scheduled to run every 5 minutes.
  * The job typically takes 6-7 minutes to complete.
  * New runs queue up while previous runs are still executing.
  * dbt platform starts cancelling queued runs to prevent infinite backlog.


When this happens, remediation is non-trivial. You need to either refactor the job to run faster (prune model selection, adjust threads, optimize SQL) or relax the schedule and accept a looser freshness SLA.
#### Related scheduler constraints[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/6-operational-considerations?version=1.12#related-scheduler-constraints "Direct link to Related scheduler constraints")
  * Run slots limit how many jobs can run concurrently. Frequent near real-time jobs can starve other deployment jobs if slot usage isn't planned.
  * The scheduler runs distinct executions of the same job serially. If one run is still in progress when the next cron fires, the second run must wait (or be cancelled in an over-scheduled scenario).


## Warehouse cost and utilization[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/6-operational-considerations?version=1.12#warehouse-cost-and-utilization "Direct link to Warehouse cost and utilization")
As the gap between job runtime and schedule interval shrinks, your warehouse is effectively running continuously to keep up with back-to-back transformation windows.
**Cost scaling example:**
  * Daily job: Warehouse runs 30 min/day = ~2% utilization
  * Hourly job: Warehouse runs 30 min × 24 = 12 hours/day = 50% utilization
  * 5-minute job: Warehouse runs nearly 24/7 = ~100% utilization


On platforms like Snowflake, ingestion options like Snowpipe for high-volume real-time feeds can be very expensive (cost per 1,000 files plus compute).
Warehouse-managed options for freshness (for example, dynamic tables and materialized views) can also be harder to predict and monitor from a cost perspective, especially when underlying data is changing frequently.
The net effect: you should treat near real-time SLAs as a premium service and pressure-test whether the business really needs minute-level freshness on each workload.
## Lambda view DAG complexity and correctness[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/6-operational-considerations?version=1.12#lambda-view-dag-complexity-and-correctness "Direct link to Lambda view DAG complexity and correctness")
If you're using the [lambda views pattern](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/4-lambda-views), you face additional complexity:
  * **Duplicated logic** : You either centralize SQL in macros (more DRY, less readable) or duplicate the same transformations in both history (HIST) and NRT flows (more readable, more to maintain).
  * **Complex DAGs** : Every "product" model now has at least three artifacts (HIST table, NRT view, lambda union), plus supporting upstream layers.
  * **Materialization brittleness** : The pattern depends on specific materializations (views vs incrementals). A seemingly harmless materialization change can break freshness or correctness.


On top of that, community experience has surfaced timing gaps between HIST and NRT flows:
  * Views (NRT) often update much faster than incremental tables. During a run, the NRT side may start filtering on the new `max(event_ts)` before the incremental table has finished loading, producing temporary holes in the unioned lambda view where recent data disappears briefly.
  * One way to mitigate is to introduce an explicit dependency from NRT to the incremental model (for example, a manual dependency on `{{ ref('fct_events') }}` comment), but this is somewhat brittle and increases coupling.


## Job reliability and resource limits[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/6-operational-considerations?version=1.12#job-reliability-and-resource-limits "Direct link to Job reliability and resource limits")
High-frequency jobs are more likely to surface job-level failures:
  * **Memory limits**
    * Memory-heavy macros (for example, large `run_query()` results) or big doc-generation steps can hit account-level memory limits.
    * This causes runs to terminate with "memory limit" errors.
  * **Auto-deactivation**
    * A job that fails repeatedly can be auto-deactivated after 100 consecutive failures.
    * When this happens, scheduled triggers stop until someone manually intervenes.
  * **Smaller margin for error**
    * A flaky model, test, or small regression can quickly generate many failed runs.
    * This creates noisy alerts and can hit the auto-deactivation threshold faster.


## Ingestion architecture dependencies[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/6-operational-considerations?version=1.12#ingestion-architecture-dependencies "Direct link to Ingestion architecture dependencies")
Lambda views and NRT dbt jobs sit on top of your ingestion architecture:
  * **The dependency**
    * If ingestion latency or throughput degrades (issues in a task/stream pipeline, backlogs in storage, intermittent Snowpipe delays), the lambda view can only union what has already arrived.
    * You can't make data fresher than your ingestion layer allows.
  * **What you end up tuning**
    * Task cadences and partition strategies in the landing zone
    * Lambda overlap windows and incremental look-backs
    * Which sources really need to participate in the NRT path


## Conclusion[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/6-operational-considerations?version=1.12#conclusion "Direct link to Conclusion")
These challenges are why we position lambda views and ultra-frequent dbt schedules as special-case patterns. They're powerful when you truly need them, but they require deliberate design around scheduler behavior, cost, DAG structure, and ingestion architecture. In many cases, they're better replaced by [dynamic tables](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/3-warehouse-native-features#dynamic-tables), [materialized views](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/3-warehouse-native-features#materialized-views), or a dedicated streaming stack.

### Where should your mesh journey start?[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-4-implementation?version=1.12#where-should-your-mesh-journey-start "Direct link to Where should your mesh journey start?")
Moving to a Mesh represents a meaningful change in development and deployment architecture. Before any sufficiently complex software refactor or migration, it's important to ask, 'Why might this not work?' The two most common reasons we've seen stem from
  1. Lack of buy-in that a Mesh is the right long-term architecture
  2. Lack of alignment on a well-scoped starting point


Creating alignment on your architecture and starting point are major steps in ensuring a successful migration. Deciding on the right starting point will look different for every organization, but there are some heuristics that can help you decide where to start. In all likelihood, your organization already has logical components, and you may already be grouping, building, and deploying your project according to these interfaces.The goal is to define and formalize these organizational interfaces and use these boundaries to split your project apart by domain.
How do you find these organizational interfaces? Here are some steps to get you started:
  * **Talk to teams** about what sort of separation naturally exists right now.
    * Are there various domains people are focused on?
    * Are there various sizes, shapes, and sources of data that get handled separately (such as click event data)?
    * Are there people focused on separate levels of transformation, such as landing and staging data or building marts?
    * Is there a single team that is _downstream_ of your current dbt project, who could more easily migrate onto Mesh as a consumer?


When attempting to define your project interfaces, you should consider investigating:
  * **Your jobs:** Which sets of models are most often built together?
  * **Your lineage graph:** How are models connected?
  * **Your selectors(defined in`selectors.yml`):** How do people already define resource groups?


Let's go through an example process of taking a monolithing project, using groups and access to define the interfaces, and then splitting it into multiple projects.
To help you get started, check out our [Quickstart with Mesh](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/mesh-qs) or our online [Mesh course](https://learn.getdbt.com/courses/dbt-mesh) to learn more!
## Defining project interfaces with groups and access[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-4-implementation?version=1.12#defining-project-interfaces-with-groups-and-access "Direct link to Defining project interfaces with groups and access")
Once you have a sense of some initial groupings, you can first implement **group and access permissions** within a single project.
  * First you can create a [group](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/groups) to define the owner of a set of models.


```
# in models/__groups.ymlgroups:-name: marketingowner:name: Ben Jaffleck email: ben.jaffleck@jaffleshop.com
```

  * Then, we can add models to that group using the `group:` key in the model's YAML entry.


```
# in models/marketing/__models.ymlmodels:-name: fct_marketing_modelconfig:group: marketing # changed to config in v1.10-name: stg_marketing_modelconfig:group: marketing # changed to config in v1.10
```

  * Once you've added models to the group, you can **add[access](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/model-access) settings to the models** based on their connections between groups, _opting for the most private access that will maintain current functionality_. This means that any model that has _only_ relationships to other models in the same group should be `private` , and any model that has cross-group relationships, or is a terminal node in the group DAG should be `protected` so that other parts of the DAG can continue to reference it.


```
# in models/marketing/__models.ymlmodels:-name: fct_marketing_modelconfig:group: marketing # changed to config in v1.10access: protected # changed to config in v1.10-name: stg_marketing_modelconfig:group: marketing # changed to config in v1.10access: private # changed to config in v1.10
```

  * **Validate these groups by incrementally migrating your jobs** to execute these groups specifically via selection syntax. We would recommend doing this in parallel to your production jobs until you’re sure about them. This will help you feel out if you’ve drawn the lines in the right place.
  * If you find yourself **consistently making changes across multiple groups** when you update logic, that’s a sign that **you may want to rethink your groups**.


## Split your projects[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-4-implementation?version=1.12#split-your-projects "Direct link to Split your projects")
  1. **Move your grouped models into a subfolder**. This will include any model in the selected group, it's associated YAML entry, as well as its parent or child resources as appropriate depending on where this group sits in your DAG.
    1. Note that just like in your dbt project, circular references are not allowed! Project B cannot have parents and children in Project A, for example.
  2. **Create a new`dbt_project.yml` file** in the subdirectory.
  3. **Copy any macros** used by the resources you moved.
  4. **Create a new`packages.yml` file** in your subdirectory with the packages that are used by the resources you moved.
  5. **Update`{{ ref }}` functions** — For any model that has a cross-project dependency (this may be in the files you moved, or in the files that remain in your project):
    1. Update the `{{ ref() }}` function to have two arguments, where the first is the name of the source project and the second is the name of the model: e.g. `{{ ref('jaffle_shop', 'my_upstream_model') }}`
    2. Update the upstream, cross-project parents’ `access` configs to `public` , ensuring any project can safely `{{ ref() }}` those models.
    3. We _highly_ recommend adding a [model contract](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/model-contracts) to the upstream models to ensure the data shape is consistent and reliable for your downstream consumers.
  6. **Create a`dependencies.yml` file** ([docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/project-dependencies)) for the downstream project, declaring the upstream project as a dependency.


```
# in dependencies.ymlprojects:-name: jaffle_shop
```

### Best practices[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-4-implementation?version=1.12#best-practices "Direct link to Best practices")
  * When you’ve **confirmed the right groups** , it's time to split your projects.
    * **Do _one_ group at a time**!
    * **Do _not_ refactor as you migrate**, however tempting that may be. Focus on getting 1-to-1 parity and log any issues you find in doing the migration for later. Once you’ve fully migrated the project then you can start optimizing it for its new life as part of your mesh.
  * Start by splitting your project within the same repository for full git tracking and easy reversion if you need to start from scratch.


## Connecting existing projects[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-4-implementation?version=1.12#connecting-existing-projects "Direct link to Connecting existing projects")
Some organizations may already be coordinating across multiple dbt projects. Most often this is via:
  1. Installing parent projects as dbt packages
  2. Using `{{ source() }}` functions to read the outputs of a parent project as inputs to a child project.


This has a few drawbacks:
  1. If using packages, each project has to include _all_ resources from _all_ projects in its manifest, slowing down dbt and the development cycle.
  2. If using sources, there are breakages in the lineage, as there's no real connection between the parent and child projects.


The migration steps here are much simpler than splitting up a monolith!
  1. If using the `package` method:
    1. In the parent project:
      1. mark all models being referenced downstream as `public` and add a model contract.
    2. In the child project:
      1. Remove the package entry from `packages.yml`
      2. Add the upstream project to your `dependencies.yml`
      3. Update the `{{ ref() }}` functions to models from the upstream project to include the project name argument.
  2. If using `source` method:
    1. In the parent project:
      1. mark all models being imported downstream as `public` and add a model contract.
    2. In the child project:
      1. Add the upstream project to your `dependencies.yml`
      2. Replace the `{{ source() }}` functions with cross project `{{ ref() }}` functions.
      3. Remove the unnecessary `source` definitions.

Before embarking on a Mesh implementation, it's important to understand if Mesh is the right fit for your team. Here, we outline three common organizational structures to help teams identify whether Mesh might fit your organization's needs.
## The enterprise data mesh[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-2-who-is-dbt-mesh-for#the-enterprise-data-mesh "Direct link to The enterprise data mesh")
Some data teams operate on a global scale. By definition, the team needs to manage, deploy, and distribute data products across a large number of teams. Central IT may own some data products or simply own the platform upon which data products are built. Often, these organizations have “architects” who can advise line-of-business teams on their work while keeping track of what’s happening globally (regarding tooling and the substance of work). This is a lot like how software organizations work beyond a certain scale.
The headcount ratio of domain teams to platform teams in this scenario is roughly ≥10:1. For each member of the central platform team, there might be dozens of members of domain-aligned data teams.
Is Mesh a good fit in this scenario? Absolutely! There is no other way to share data products at scale. One dbt project would not keep up with the global demands of an organization like this.
### Tips and tricks[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-2-who-is-dbt-mesh-for#tips-and-tricks "Direct link to Tips and tricks")
  * **Managing shared macros** : Teams operating at this scale will benefit from a separate repository containing a dbt package of reusable utility macros that all other projects will install. This is different from public models, which provide data-as-a-service (a set of “API endpoints”) — this is distributed as a **library**. This package can also standardize imports of other third-party packages, as well as providing wrappers / shims for those macros. This package should have a dedicated team of maintainers — probably the central platform team, or a set of “superusers” from domain-aligned data modeling teams.


To help you get started, check out our [Quickstart with Mesh](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/mesh-qs) or our online [Mesh course](https://learn.getdbt.com/courses/dbt-mesh) to learn more!
### Adoption challenges[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-2-who-is-dbt-mesh-for#adoption-challenges "Direct link to Adoption challenges")
  * Onboarding hundreds of people and dozens of projects is full of friction! The challenges of a scaled, global organization are not to be underestimated. To start the migration, prioritize teams that have strong dbt familiarity and fundamentals. Mesh is an advancement of core dbt deployments, so these teams are likely to have a smoother transition.
Additionally, prioritize teams that manage strategic data assets that need to be shared widely. This ensures that Mesh will help your teams deliver concrete value quickly.


If this sounds like your organization, Mesh is the architecture you should pursue. ✅
## Hub and spoke[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-2-who-is-dbt-mesh-for#hub-and-spoke "Direct link to Hub and spoke")
Some slightly smaller organizations still operate with a central data team serving several business-aligned analytics teams in a ~5:1 headcount ratio. These central teams look less like an IT function and more like a modern data platform team of analytics engineers. This team provides the majority of the data products to the rest of the org, as well as the infrastructure for downstream analytics teams to spin up their own spoke projects to ensure quality and maintenance of the core platform.
Is Mesh a good fit in this scenario? Almost certainly! If your central data team starts to bottleneck analysts’ work, you need a way for those teams to operate relatively independently while still ensuring the quality of the most used data products. Mesh is designed to solve this exact problem.
### Tips and tricks[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-2-who-is-dbt-mesh-for#tips-and-tricks-1 "Direct link to Tips and tricks")
  * **Data products by some, for all:** The spoke teams shouldn’t produce public models. By contrast, development in the hub team project should be slower, more careful, and focus on producing foundational public models shared across domains. We’d recommend giving hub team members access (at least read-only) to downstream projects, which will help with more granular impact analysis within Catalog. If a public model isn’t used in any downstream project or a specific column in that model, the hub team can feel better about removing it. However, they should still utilize the dbt governance features like `deprecation_date` and `version` as appropriate to set expectations. If there is a need for a public model in a spoke project to be shared across multiple projects, consider first whether it could or should be moved to the hub project.
  * **Sources:** Spokes should be allowed/encouraged to define and use _domain-specific_ data sources. The platform team should not need to worry about, say, `Thinkific` data when building core data marts, but the Training project may need to. _No two sources anywhere in a dbt mesh should point to the same relation object._ If a spoke feels like they need to use a source the hub already uses, the interfaces should change so that the spoke can get what they need from the platform project.
  * **Project quality:** More analyst-focused teams will have different skill levels & quality bars. Owning their data means they own the consequences as well. Rather than being accountable for the end-to-end delivery of data assets, the Hub team is an enablement team: their role is to provide guardrails and quality checks, but not to fix all the issues exactly to their liking (and thereby remain a bottleneck).


### Adoption challenges[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-2-who-is-dbt-mesh-for#adoption-challenges-1 "Direct link to Adoption challenges")
There are trade-offs to using this architecture, especially for the hub team managing and maintaining public models. This workflow has intentional friction to reduce the chances of unintentional model changes that break unspoken data contracts. These assurances may come with some sacrifices, such as faster onboarding or more flexible development workflows. Compared to having a single project, where a select few are doing all the development work, this architecture optimizes for slower development from a wider group of people.
If this sounds like your organization, it's very likely that Mesh is a good fit for you. ✅
## Single team monolith[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-2-who-is-dbt-mesh-for#single-team-monolith "Direct link to Single team monolith")
Some organizations operate on an even smaller scale. If your data org is a single small team that controls the end-to-end process of building and maintaining all data products at the organization, Mesh may not be required. The complexity in projects comes from having a wide variety of data sources and stakeholders. However, given the team's size, operating on a single codebase may be the most efficient way to manage data products. Generally, if a team of this size and scope is looking to implement Mesh, it's likely that they are looking for better interface design and/or performance improvements for certain parts of their dbt DAG, and not because they necessarily have an organizational pain point to solve.
_Is Mesh a good fit?_ Maybe! There are reasons to separate out parts of a large monolithic project into several to better orchestrate and manage the models. However, if the same people are managing each project, they may find that the overhead of managing multiple projects is not worth the benefits.
If this sounds like your organization, it's worth considering whether Mesh is a good fit for you.

Mesh is a new architecture enabled by dbt. It allows you to better manage complexity by deploying multiple interconnected dbt projects instead of a single large, monolithic project. It’s designed to accelerate development, without compromising governance.
## Overview of Mesh[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-5-faqs#overview-of-mesh "Direct link to Overview of Mesh")
What are the main benefits of implementing dbt Mesh?
Here are some benefits of implementing dbt Mesh:
  * **Ship data products faster** : With a more modular architecture, teams can make changes rapidly and independently in specific areas without impacting the entire system, leading to faster development cycles.
  * **Improve trust in data:** Adopting dbt Mesh helps ensure that changes in one domain's data models do not unexpectedly break dependencies in other domain areas, leading to a more secure and predictable data environment.
  * **Reduce complexity** : By organizing transformation logic into distinct domains, dbt Mesh reduces the complexity inherent in large, monolithic projects, making them easier to manage and understand.
  * **Improve collaboration** : Teams are able to share and build upon each other's work without duplicating efforts.


Most importantly, all this can be accomplished without the central data team losing the ability to see lineage across the entire organization, or compromising on governance mechanisms.
What are model contracts?
dbt [model contracts](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/model-contracts) serve as a governance tool enabling the definition and enforcement of data structure standards in your dbt models. They allow you to specify and uphold data model guarantees, including column data types, allowing for the stability of dependent models. Should a model fail to adhere to its established contracts, it will not build successfully.
What are model versions?
dbt [model versions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/model-versions) are iterations of your dbt models made over time. In many cases, you might knowingly choose to change a model’s structure in a way that “breaks” the previous model contract, and may break downstream queries depending on that model’s structure. When you do so, creating a new version of the model is useful to signify this change.
You can use model versions to:
  * Test "prerelease" changes (in production, in downstream systems).
  * Bump the latest version, to be used as the canonical "source of truth."
  * Offer a migration window off the "old" version.


What are model access modifiers?
A [model access modifier](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/model-access) in dbt determines if a model is accessible as an input to other dbt models and projects. It specifies where a model can be referenced using [the `ref` function](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/ref). There are three types of access modifiers:
  * **Private:** A model with a private access modifier is only referenceable by models within the same group. This is intended for models that are implementation details and are meant to be used only within a specific group of related models.
  * **Protected:** Models with a protected access modifier can be referenced by any other model within the same dbt project or when the project is installed as a package. This is the default setting for all models, ensuring backward compatibility, especially when groups are assigned to an existing set of models.
  * **Public:** A public model can be referenced across different groups, packages, or projects. This is suitable for stable and mature models that serve as interfaces for other teams or projects.


What are model groups?
A [model group](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/model-access#groups) in dbt is a concept used to organize models under a common category or ownership. This categorization can be based on various criteria, such as the team responsible for the models or the specific data source they model.
What are some potential challenges when using dbt Mesh?
This is a new way of working, and the intentionality required to build, and then maintain, cross-project interfaces and dependencies may feel like a slowdown versus what some developers are used to. The intentional friction introduced promotes thoughtful changes, fostering a mindset that values stability and systematic adjustments over rapid transformations.
Orchestration across multiple projects is also likely to be slightly more challenging for many organizations, although we’re currently developing new functionality that will make this process simpler.
How does this relate to the concept of data mesh?
dbt Mesh allows you to better _operationalize_ data mesh by enabling decentralized, domain-specific data ownership and collaboration.
In data mesh, each business domain is responsible for its data as a product. This is the same goal that dbt Mesh facilitates by enabling organizations to break down large, monolithic data projects into smaller, domain-specific dbt projects. Each team or domain can independently develop, maintain, and share its data models, fostering a decentralized data environment.
dbt Mesh also enhances the interoperability and reusability of data across different domains, a key aspect of the data mesh philosophy. By allowing cross-project references and shared governance through model contracts and access controls, dbt Mesh ensures that while data ownership is decentralized, there is still a governed structure to the overall data architecture.
## How dbt Mesh works[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-5-faqs#how-dbt-mesh-works "Direct link to How dbt Mesh works")
Can dbt Mesh handle cyclic dependencies between projects?
You can enable bidirectional dependencies across projects so these relationships can go in either direction, meaning that the `jaffle_finance` project can add a new model that depends on any public models produced by the `jaffle_marketing` project, so long as the new dependency doesn't introduce any node-level cycles. dbt checks for cycles across projects and raises errors if any are detected.
When setting up projects that depend on each other, it's important to do so in a stepwise fashion. Each project must run and produce public models before the original producer project can take a dependency on the original consumer project. For example, the order of operations would be as follows for a simple two-project setup:
  1. The `project_a` project runs in a deployment environment and produces public models.
  2. The `project_b` project adds `project_a` as a dependency.
  3. The `project_b` project runs in a deployment environment and produces public models.
  4. The `project_a` project adds `project_b` as a dependency.


Is it possible for multiple projects to directly reference a shared source?
While it’s not currently possible to share sources across projects, it would be possible to have a shared foundational project, with staging models on top of those sources, exposed as “public” models to other teams/projects.
What if a model I've already built on from another project later becomes protected?
This would be a breaking change for downstream consumers of that model. If the maintainers of the upstream project wish to remove the model (or “downgrade” its access modifier, effectively the same thing), they should mark that model for deprecation (using [deprecation_date](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/deprecation_date)), which will deliver a warning to all downstream consumers of that model.
In the future, we plan for dbt to also be able to proactively flag this scenario in [continuous integration](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/continuous-integration) for the maintainers of the upstream public model.
If I run `dbt build --select +model`, will this trigger a run of upstream models in other projects?
No, unless upstream projects are installed as [packages](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/packages) (source code). In that case, the models in project installed as a project become “your” models, and you can select or run them. There are cases in which this can be desirable; see docs on [project dependencies](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/project-dependencies).
If each project/domain has its own data warehouse, is it still possible to build models across them?
Yes, as long as they’re in the same data platform (BigQuery, Databricks, Redshift, Snowflake, etc.) and you have configured permissions and sharing in that data platform provider to allow this.
Can I run tests that involve tables from multiple different projects?
Yes, because the cross-project collaboration is done using the `{{ ref() }}` macro, you can use those models from other teams in [singular tests](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/data-tests#singular-data-tests).
Which team's data schema would dbt Mesh create?
Each team defines their connection to the data warehouse, and the default schema names for dbt to use when materializing datasets.
By default, each project belonging to a team will create:
  * One schema for production runs (for example, `finance`).
  * One schema per developer (for example, `dev_jerco`).


Depending on each team’s needs, this can be customized with model-level [schema configurations](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/custom-schemas), including the ability to define different rules by environment.
Is it possible to apply model contracts to source data?
No, contracts can only be applied at the [model level](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/model-contracts). It is a recommended best practice to [define staging models](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/2-staging) on top of sources, and it is possible to define contracts on top of those staging models.
Can contracts be partially enforced?
No. A contract applies to an entire model, including all columns in the model’s output. This is the same set of columns that a consumer would see when viewing the model’s details in Explorer, or when querying the model in the data platform.
  * If you wish to contract only a subset of columns, you can create a separate model (materialized as a view) selecting only that subset.
  * If you wish to limit which rows or columns a downstream consumer can see when they query the model’s data, depending on who they are, some data platforms offer advanced capabilities around dynamic row-level access and column-level data masking.


Can I have multiple owners in a group?
No, a [group](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/model-access#groups) can only be assigned to a single owner. However, the assigned owner can be a _team_ , rather than an individual.
Can contracts be assigned individual owners?
Not directly, but contracts are [assigned to models](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/model-contracts) and models can be assigned to individual owners. You can use meta fields for this purpose.
Can I make a model “public” only for specific team(s) to use?
This is not currently possible, but something we hope to enable in the near future. If you’re interested in this functionality, please reach out to your dbt Labs account team.
Is it possible to orchestrate job runs across multiple different projects?
dbt will soon offer the capability to trigger jobs on the completion of another job, including a job in a different project. This offers one mechanism for executing a pipeline from start to finish across projects.
Integrations available between the dbt Discovery API and other tools for cross-project lineage?
Yes. In addition to being viewable natively through [Catalog](https://www.getdbt.com/product/dbt-explorer), it is possible to view cross-project lineage connect using partner integrations with data cataloging tools. For a list of available dbt integrations, refer to the [Integrations page](https://www.getdbt.com/product/integrations).
How does data restatement work in dbt Mesh, particularly when fixing a data set bug?
Tests and model contracts in dbt help eliminate the need to restate data in the first place. With these tools, you can incorporate checks at the source and output layers of your dbt projects to assess data quality in the most critical places. When there are changes in transformation logic (for example, the definition of a particular column is changed), restating the data is as easy as merging the updated code and running a dbt job.
If a data quality issue does slip through, you also have the option of simply rolling back the git commit, and then re-running the dbt job with the old code.
How does dbt handle job run logs and can it feed them to standard monitoring tools, reports, etc.?
Yes, all of this metadata is accessible via the [dbt Admin API](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/admin-cloud-api). This metadata can be fed into a monitoring tool, or used to create reports and dashboards.
We also expose some of this information in dbt itself in [jobs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/jobs), [environments](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/environments-in-dbt) and in [Catalog](https://www.getdbt.com/product/dbt-explorer).
Can dbt Mesh reference models in other accounts within the same data platform?
You can reference models in other accounts within the same data platform by leveraging the data-sharing capabilities of that platform, as long as the database identifier of the public model is consistent across the producer and consumer.
For example, [Snowflake cross-account data shares](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-sharing-intro), [Databricks Unity Catalog across workspaces](https://docs.databricks.com/en/data-governance/unity-catalog/index.html), or multiple BigQuery projects.
## Permissions and access[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-5-faqs#permissions-and-access "Direct link to Permissions and access")
How do user access permissions work in dbt Mesh?
The existence of projects that have at least one public model will be visible to everyone in the organization with [read-only access](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/seats-and-users).
Private or protected models require a user to have read-only access to the specific project to see its existence.
How do all the different types of “access” interact?
There’s model-level access within dbt, role-based access for users and groups in dbt, and access to the underlying data within the data platform.
First things first: access to underlying data is always defined and enforced by the underlying data platform (for example, BigQuery, Databricks, Redshift, Snowflake, Starburst, etc.) This access is managed by executing “DCL statements” (namely `grant`). dbt makes it easy to [configure `grants` on models](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/grants), which provision data access for other roles/users/groups in the data warehouse. However, dbt does _not_ automatically define or coordinate those grants unless they are configured explicitly. Refer to your organization's system for managing data warehouse permissions.
[dbt Enterprise and Enterprise+ plans](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing) support [role-based access control (RBAC)](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/about-user-access#role-based-access-control-) that manages granular permissions for users and user groups. You can control which users can see or edit all aspects of a dbt project. A user’s access to dbt projects also determines whether they can “explore” that project in detail. Roles, users, and groups are defined within the dbt application via the UI or by integrating with an identity provider.
[Model access](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/model-access) defines where models can be referenced. It also informs the discoverability of those projects within Catalog. Model `access` is defined in code, just like any other model configuration (`materialized`, `tags`, etc).
  * **Public:** Models with `public` access can be referenced everywhere. These are the “data products” of your organization.
  * **Protected:** Models with `protected` access can only be referenced within the same project. This is the default level of model access. We are discussing a future extension to `protected` models to allow for their reference in _specific_ downstream projects. Please read [the GitHub issue](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/9340), and upvote/comment if you’re interested in this use case.
  * **Private:** Model `groups` enable more-granular control over where `private` models can be referenced. By defining a group, and configuring models to belong to that group, you can restrict other models (not in the same group) from referencing any `private` models the group contains. Groups also provide a standard mechanism for defining the `owner` of all resources it contains.


Within Catalog, `public` models are discoverable for every user in the dbt account — every public model is listed in the “multi-project” view. By contrast, `protected` and `private` models in a project are visible only to users who have access to that project (including read-only access).
Because dbt does not implicitly coordinate data warehouse `grants` with model-level `access`, it is possible for there to be a mismatch between them. For example, a `public` model’s metadata is viewable to all dbt users, anyone can write a `ref` to that model, but when they actually run or preview, they realize they do not have access to the underlying data in the data warehouse. **This is intentional.** In this way, your organization can retain least-privileged access to underlying data, while providing visibility and discoverability for the wider organization. Armed with the knowledge of which other “data products” (public models) exist — their descriptions, their ownership, which columns they contain — an analyst on another team can prepare a well-informed request for access to the underlying data.
Is it possible to request access permissions from other teams within dbt?
Not currently! But this is something we may evaluate in the future.
As a central data team member, can I still maintain visibility on the entire organizational DAG?
Yes! As long as a user has permissions (at least read-only access) on all projects in a dbt account, they can navigate across the entirety of the organization’s DAG in Catalog, and see models at all levels of detail.
How can I limit my developers from accessing sensitive production data when referencing from other projects?
By default, cross-project references resolve to the “Production” deployment environment of the upstream project. If your organization has genuinely different data in production versus non-production environments, this poses an issue.
For this reason, we rolled out canonical type of deployment environment: “[Staging](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/deploy-environments#staging-environment).” If a project defines both a “Production” environment and a “Staging” environment, then cross-project references from development and “Staging” environments will resolve to “Staging,” whereas only references coming from “Production” environments will resolve to “Production.” In this way, you are guaranteed separation of data environments, without needing to duplicate project configurations.
Does dbt Mesh work if projects are 'duplicated' (dev project <> prod project)?
The short answer is "no." Cross-project references require that each project `name` be unique in your dbt account.
Historical limitations required customers to "duplicate" projects so that one actual dbt project (codebase) would map to more than one dbt project. To that end, we are working to remove the historical limitations that required customers to "duplicate" projects in dbt — Staging environments for data isolation, environment-level permissions, and environment-level data warehouse connections (coming soon). Once those pieces are in place, it should no longer be necessary to define separate dbt projects to isolate data environments or permissions.
## Compatibility with other features[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-5-faqs#compatibility-with-other-features "Direct link to Compatibility with other features")
How does the dbt Semantic Layer relate to and work with dbt Mesh?
The [Semantic Layer](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/dbt-sl) and dbt Mesh are complementary mechanisms enabled by dbt that work together to enhance the management, usability, and governance of data in large-scale data environments.
The Semantic Layer in dbt allows teams to centrally define business metrics and dimensions. It ensures consistent and reliable metric definitions across various analytics tools and platforms.
Mesh enables organizations to split their data architecture into multiple domain-specific projects, while retaining the ability to reference “public” models across projects. It is also possible to reference a “public” model from another project for the purpose of defining semantic models and metrics. Your organization can have multiple dbt projects feed into a unified semantic layer, ensuring that metrics and dimensions are consistently defined and understood across these domains.
When using the dbt Semantic Layer in a [dbt Mesh](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-1-intro) setting, we recommend the following:
  * You have one standalone project that contains your semantic models and metrics.
  * Then as you build your Semantic Layer, you can [cross-reference dbt models](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/project-dependencies) across your various projects or packages to create your semantic models using the [two-argument `ref` function](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/ref#ref-project-specific-models)( `ref('project_name', 'model_name')`).
  * Your dbt Semantic Layer project serves as a global source of truth across the rest of your projects.


#### Usage example[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-5-faqs#usage-example "Direct link to Usage example")
For example, let's say you have a public model (`fct_orders`) that lives in the `jaffle_finance` project. As you build your semantic model, use the following syntax to ref the model:
Notice that in the `model` parameter, we're using the `ref` function with two arguments to reference the public model `fct_orders` defined in the `jaffle_finance` project.
How does dbt Catalog relate to and work with dbt Mesh?
is a tool within dbt that serves as a knowledge base and lineage visualization platform. It provides a comprehensive view of your dbt assets, including models, tests, sources, and their interdependencies.
Used in conjunction with dbt Mesh, Catalog becomes a powerful tool for visualizing and understanding the relationships and dependencies between models across multiple dbt projects.
How does the dbt CLI relate to and work with dbt Mesh?
The [dbt CLI](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/cloud-cli-installation) allows users to develop and run dbt commands from their preferred development environments, like VS Code, Sublime Text, or terminal interfaces. This flexibility is particularly beneficial in a dbt Mesh setup, where managing multiple projects can be complex. Developers can work in their preferred tools while leveraging the centralized capabilities of dbt.
Can I upgrade Mesh projects to Fusion incrementally?
Yes! You can upgrade select projects to the dbt Fusion engine while keeping others on dbt Core.
  * Fusion projects can reference public models from dbt Core projects
  * dbt Core projects can reference public models from Fusion projects


This works because dbt Mesh uses a publication artifact (not the manifest) to resolve cross-project references, and this artifact is identical between dbt Core and Fusion.
You can upgrade dbt Mesh projects to Fusion in any order and there's no requirement to start with upstream or downstream projects first.
While basic Mesh functionality works in hybrid setups, some advanced platform features (like full Catalog lineage visibility across projects) work best when all projects use the same engine.
## Availability[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-5-faqs#availability "Direct link to Availability")
Does dbt Mesh require me to be on a specific version of dbt?
Yes, your account must be on [at least dbt v1.6](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/upgrade-dbt-version-in-cloud) to take advantage of [cross-project dependencies](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/project-dependencies), one of the most crucial underlying capabilities required to implement a dbt Mesh.
Is there a way to leverage dbt Mesh capabilities in dbt Core?
While dbt Core defines several of the foundational elements for dbt Mesh, dbt offers an enhanced experience that leverages these elements for scaled collaboration across multiple teams, facilitated by multi-project discovery in Catalog that’s tailored to each user’s access.
Several key components that underpin the dbt Mesh pattern, including [model contracts, versions, and access modifiers](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/about-model-governance), are defined and implemented in dbt Core. We believe these are components of the core language, which is why their implementations are open source. We want to define a standard pattern that analytics engineers everywhere can adopt, extend, and help us improve.
To reference models defined in another project, users can also leverage [packages](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/packages), a longstanding feature of dbt Core. By importing an upstream project as a package, dbt will import all models defined in that project, which enables the resolution of cross-project references to those models. They can be [optionally restricted](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/model-access#how-do-i-restrict-access-to-models-defined-in-a-package) to just the models with `public` access.
The major distinction comes with dbt's metadata service, which is unique to the dbt platform and allows for the resolution of references to only the public models in a project. This service enables users to take dependencies on upstream projects, and reference just their `public` models, _without_ needing to load the full complexity of those upstream projects into their local development environment.
Does dbt Mesh require a specific dbt plan?
Yes, a [dbt Enterprise-tier](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing) plan is required to set up multiple projects and reference models across them. Refer to [model governance](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/about-model-governance) for more information on the features available across dbt plans.
## Tips on implementing dbt Mesh[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-5-faqs#tips-on-implementing-dbt-mesh "Direct link to Tips on implementing dbt Mesh")
Is there a recommended migration or implementation process?
Refer to our developer guide on [How we structure our dbt Mesh projects](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-1-intro).
You can also learn how to implement dbt Mesh by following our [Quickstart dbt Mesh](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/mesh-qs) guide.
My team isn’t structured to require multiple projects today. What aspects of dbt Mesh are relevant to me?
Let’s say your organization has fewer than 500 models and fewer than a dozen regular contributors to dbt. You're operating at a scale well served by the monolith (a single project), and the larger pattern of dbt Mesh probably won't provide any immediate benefits.
It’s never too early to think about how you’re organizing models _within_ that project. Use model `groups` to define clear ownership boundaries and `private` access to restrict purpose-built models from becoming load-bearing blocks in an unrelated section of the DAG. Your future selves will thank you for defining these interfaces, especially if you reach a scale where it makes sense to “graduate” the interfaces between `groups` into boundaries between projects.

Modern data warehouses offer native features that can simplify near real-time data patterns. Instead of managing incremental logic yourself, you can declare the desired freshness and let the warehouse handle the refresh mechanics.
This section covers when to use dynamic tables and materialized views instead of incremental models for near real-time data.
  * [Dynamic tables](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/snowflake-configs#dynamic-tables) are a warehouse-specific feature in Snowflake that lets the warehouse keep a table updated for you. You define what the table should look like, and the warehouse keeps the table fresh automatically.
  * [Materialized views](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/materializations#materialized-view) are a warehouse-specific feature that lets the warehouse save the results of a query so they’re faster to read, and refresh them as the underlying data changes. Note that the exact behavior depends on the warehouse.
  * [Incremental models](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-models) are a dbt feature that lets dbt update a table by processing only new data. You tell dbt how new data should be added using your incremental logic SQL, and dbt runs the right SQL when the model is built.


#### When to consider warehouse-native features[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/3-warehouse-native-features?version=1.12#when-to-consider-warehouse-native-features "Direct link to When to consider warehouse-native features")
**Use dynamic tables or materialized views when:**
  * Your requirement is "data always within X minutes of real time" and you don't need precise scheduling control.
  * You want to simplify operational complexity by offloading refresh logic to the warehouse.
  * Your transformations are relatively straightforward.
  * You're willing to trade some control for convenience.


**Stick with incremental models when:**
  * You need fine-grained control over scheduling and refresh logic,
  * You have complex business rules requiring custom incremental strategies (like microbatching).
  * You need to coordinate refreshes across multiple models in a specific order.


## Dynamic tables[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/3-warehouse-native-features?version=1.12#dynamic-tables "Direct link to Dynamic tables")
Dynamic tables are currently supported in Snowflake, with similar features available in other warehouses under different names. Check your warehouse documentation for availability.
With dynamic tables, you can define the target state with SQL, and the warehouse automatically handles incremental refreshes.
For example, the following SQL model uses a dynamic table to keep a table up to date for you:
```
{{ config(    materialized ='dynamic_table',    target_lag ='5 minutes',    snowflake_warehouse ='TRANSFORM_WH'-- Snowflake syntaxselect    event_id,    event_ts::timestamp_ntz as event_ts,    to_date(event_ts)as event_date,    user_id,    event_type,    payloadfrom {{ source('raw','events') }}where event_ts >=current_timestamp()-interval'7 days';
```

#### target_lag config[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/3-warehouse-native-features?version=1.12#target_lag-config "Direct link to target_lag config")
The [`target_lag` parameter](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/snowflake-configs#target-lag) tells the warehouse the maximum acceptable staleness of the dynamic table relative to its sources, and helps determine when the table should be refreshed.
For example:
  * `target_lag = '1 minute'` - Warehouse keeps the table within one minute of its source data, refreshing automatically as needed.
  * `target_lag = '5 minutes'` - Table may lag up to five minutes behind its sources.
  * `target_lag = 'downstream'` - Table refreshes only when a downstream table depends on it.
  * `target_lag = '1 minute'` - Data refreshed to be within 1 minute of the source
  * `target_lag = '5 minutes'` - Data within 5 minutes
  * `target_lag = 'downstream'` - Refresh when downstream tables need it


The warehouse automatically determines when to refresh, whether to do a full or incremental update, and how to optimize the refresh query.
#### Benefits[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/3-warehouse-native-features?version=1.12#benefits "Direct link to Benefits")
  * Declarative freshness: specify "how fresh" not "when to refresh"
  * Warehouse-managed optimization
  * Cost predictability: refreshes run only when needed to meet `target_lag`
  * Simple setup


#### Limitations[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/3-warehouse-native-features?version=1.12#limitations "Direct link to Limitations")
  * Less control over exact timing or orchestration logic
  * Cost visibility can be harder to predict than scheduled dbt jobs
  * Less visibility into refresh decisions compared to dbt's explicit incremental logic
  * Currently warehouse-specific (implementation varies by platform)


## Materialized views[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/3-warehouse-native-features?version=1.12#materialized-views "Direct link to Materialized views")
Materialized views are available in most modern data warehouses and cache query results that automatically refresh when underlying data changes.
Materialized views work like this:
  * The warehouse detects changes to source tables and refreshes the materialized view.
  * Many warehouses can incrementally update the view rather than recomputing everything.
  * Queries against the materialized view read cached results, not the underlying tables.


For example, the following sql model uses a materialized view to keep a table up to date for you:
```
{{ config(    materialized ='materialized_view'select    user_id,    date_trunc('hour', event_ts)as event_hour,count(*)as event_countfrom {{ source('raw','events') }}groupby1,2;
```

## More advanced metric types[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-5-advanced-metrics#more-advanced-metric-types "Direct link to More advanced metric types")
We're not limited to just passing measures through to our metrics, we can also _combine_ measures to model more advanced metrics.
  * 🍊 **Ratio** metrics are, as the name implies, about **comparing two metrics as a numerator and a denominator** to form a new metric, for instance the percentage of order items that are food items instead of drinks.
  * 🧱 **Derived** metrics are when we want to **write an expression** that calculates a metric **using multiple metrics**. A classic example here is our gross profit calculated by subtracting costs from revenue.
  * ➕ **Cumulative** metrics calculate all of a **measure over a given window** , such as the past week, or if no window is supplied, the all-time total of that measure.


## Ratio metrics[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-5-advanced-metrics#ratio-metrics "Direct link to Ratio metrics")
  * 🔢 We need to establish one measure that will be our **numerator** , and one that will be our **denominator**.
  * 🥪 Let's calculate the **percentage** of our Jaffle Shop revenue that **comes from food items**.
  * 💰 We already have our denominator, revenue, but we'll want to **make a new metric for our numerator** called `food_revenue`.


models/marts/orders.yml
```
-name: food_revenuedescription: The revenue from food in each order.label: Food Revenuetype: simpletype_params:measure: food_revenue
```

  * 📝 Now we can set up our ratio metric.


models/marts/orders.yml
```
-name: food_revenue_pctdescription: The % of order revenue from food.label: Food Revenue %type: ratiotype_params:numerator: food_revenuedenominator: revenue
```

## Derived metrics[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-5-advanced-metrics#derived-metrics "Direct link to Derived metrics")
  * 🆙 Now let's really have some fun. One of the most important metrics for any business is not just revenue, but _revenue growth_. Let's use a derived metric to build month-over-month revenue.
  * ⚙️ A derived metric has a couple key components:
    * 📚 A list of metrics to build on. These can be manipulated and filtered in various way, here we'll use the `offset_window` property to lag by a month.
    * 🧮 An expression that performs a calculation with these metrics.
  * With these parts we can assemble complex logic that would otherwise need to be 'frozen' in logical models.


models/marts/orders.yml
```
-name: revenue_growth_momdescription:"Percentage growth of revenue compared to 1 month ago. Excluded tax"type: derivedlabel: Revenue Growth % M/Mtype_params:expr: (current_revenue - revenue_prev_month) * 100 / revenue_prev_monthmetrics:-name: revenuealias: current_revenue-name: revenueoffset_window: 1 monthalias: revenue_prev_month
```

## Cumulative metrics[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-5-advanced-metrics#cumulative-metrics "Direct link to Cumulative metrics")
  * ➕ Lastly, lets build a **cumulative metric**. In keeping with our theme of business priorities, let's continue with revenue and build an **all-time revenue metric** for any given time window.
  * 🪟 All we need to do is indicate the type is `cumulative` and not supply a `window` in the `type_params`, which indicates we want cumulative for the entire time period our end users select.


models/marts/orders.yml
```
-name: cumulative_revenuedescription: The cumulative revenue for all orders.label: Cumulative Revenue (All Time)type: cumulativetype_params:measure: revenue
```

On this page
Note that this best practices guide doesn't yet use the [new YAML specification](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/latest-metrics-spec). We're working on updating this guide to use the new spec and file structure soon!
To read more about the new spec, see [Creating metrics](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/metrics-overview).
## Files and Folders[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-7-semantic-structure?version=1.12#files-and-folders "Direct link to Files and Folders")
The first thing you need to establish is how you’re going to consistently structure your code. There are two recommend best practices to choose from:
  * 🏡 **Co-locate your semantic layer code** in a one-YAML-file-per-marts-model system.
    * Puts documentation, data tests, unit tests, semantic models, and metrics into a unified file that corresponds to a dbt-modeled mart.
    * Trades larger file size for less clicking between files.
    * Simpler for greenfield projects that are building the Semantic Layer alongside dbt models.
  * 🏘️**Create a sub-folder** called `models/semantic_models/`.
    * Create a parallel file and folder structure within that specifically for semantic layer code.
    * Gives you more targeted files, but may involves switching between files more often.
    * Better for migrating large existing projects, as you can quickly see what marts have been codified into the Semantic Layer.


It’s not terribly difficult to shift between these (it can be done with some relatively straightforward shell scripting), and this is purely a decision based on your developers’ preference (i.e. it has no impact on execution or performance), so don’t feel locked in to either path. Just pick the one that feels right and you can always shift down the road if you change your mind.
Make sure to save all semantic models and metrics under the directory defined in the [`model-paths`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/project-configs/model-paths) (or a subdirectory of it, like `models/semantic_models/`). If you save them outside of this path, it will result in an empty `semantic_manifest.json` file, and your semantic models or metrics won't be recognized.
## Naming[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-7-semantic-structure?version=1.12#naming "Direct link to Naming")
Next, establish your system for consistent file naming:
  * 1️⃣ If you’re doing **one-YAML-file-per-mart** then you’d have an `orders.sql` and an `orders.yml`.
  * 📛 If you’re using a **parallel subfolder approach** , for the sake of unique file names it’s recommended to use the **prefix`sem_` e.g. `sem_orders.yml`** for the dedicated semantic model and metrics that build on `orders.sql` and `orders.yml`.


## Can't decide?[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-7-semantic-structure?version=1.12#cant-decide "Direct link to Can't decide?")
Start with a dedicated subfolder for your semantic models and metrics, and then if you find that you’re spending a lot of time clicking between files, you can always shift to a one-YAML-file-per-mart system. Our internal data team has found that the dedicated subfolder approach is more manageable for migrating existing projects, and this is the approach our documentation uses, so if you can't pick go with that.

## Putting it all together[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-9-conclusion?version=1.12#putting-it-all-together "Direct link to Putting it all together")
  * 📊 We've walked through **creating semantic models and metrics** for basic coverage of a key business area.
  * 🔁 In doing so we've looked at how to **refactor a frozen rollup** into a dynamic, flexible new life in the Semantic Layer.


## Best practices[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-9-conclusion?version=1.12#best-practices "Direct link to Best practices")
  * ✅ **Prefer normalization** when possible to allow MetricFlow to denormalize dynamically for end users.
  * ✅ Use **marts to denormalize** when needed, for instance grouping tables together into richer components, or getting measures on dimensional tables attached to a table with a time spine.
  * ✅ When source data is **well normalized** you can **build semantic models on top of staging models**.
  * ✅ **Prefer** computing values in **measures and metrics** when possible as opposed to in frozen rollups.
  * ❌ **Don't directly refactor the code you have in production** , build in parallel so you can audit the Semantic Layer output and deprecate old marts gracefully.


## Key commands[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-9-conclusion?version=1.12#key-commands "Direct link to Key commands")
  * 🔑 Use `dbt parse` to generate a fresh semantic manifest.
  * 🔑 Use `dbt sl list dimensions --metrics [metric name]` to check that you're increasing dimensionality as you progress.
  * 🔑 Use `dbt sl query [query options]` to preview the output from your metrics as you develop.


## Next steps[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-9-conclusion?version=1.12#next-steps "Direct link to Next steps")
  * 🗺️ Use these best practices to map out your team's plan to **incrementally adopt the Semantic Layer**.
  * 🤗 Get involved in the community and ask questions, **help craft best practices** , and share your progress in building a Semantic Layer.
  * [Validate semantic nodes in CI](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/ci-jobs#semantic-validations-in-ci) to ensure code changes made to dbt models don't break these metrics.


The Semantic Layer is the biggest paradigm shift thus far in the young practice of analytics engineering. It's ready to provide value right away, but is most impactful if you move your project towards increasing normalization, and allow MetricFlow to do the denormalization for you with maximum dimensionality.
We will be releasing more resources soon covering implementation of the Semantic Layer in dbt with various integrated BI tools. This is just the beginning, hopefully this guide has given you a path forward for building your data platform in this new era. Refer to [Semantic Layer FAQs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/sl-faqs) for more information.

## What is dbt Mesh?[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-1-intro?version=1.12#what-is-dbt-mesh "Direct link to What is dbt Mesh?")
Organizations of all sizes rely upon dbt to manage their data transformations, from small startups to large enterprises. At scale, it can be challenging to coordinate all the organizational and technical requirements demanded by your stakeholders within the scope of a single dbt project.
To date, there also hasn't been a first-class way to effectively manage the dependencies, governance, and workflows between multiple dbt projects.
That's where **Mesh** comes in - empowering data teams to work _independently and collaboratively_ ; sharing data, code, and best practices without sacrificing security or autonomy.
Mesh is not a single product - it is a pattern enabled by a convergence of several features in dbt:
  * **[Cross-project references](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/project-dependencies#how-to-write-cross-project-ref)** - this is the foundational feature that enables the multi-project deployments. `{{ ref() }}`s now work across dbt projects on Enterprise and Enterprise+ plans.
  * - dbt's metadata-powered documentation platform, complete with full, cross-project lineage.
  * **Governance** - dbt's governance features allow you to manage access to your dbt models both within and across projects.
    * - With groups, you can organize nodes in your dbt DAG that share a logical connection (for example, by functional area) and assign an owner to the entire group.
    * - access configs allow you to control who can reference models.
    * - when coordinating across projects and teams, we recommend treating your data models as stable APIs. Model versioning is the mechanism to allow graceful adoption and deprecation of models as they evolve.
    * - data contracts set explicit expectations on the shape of the data to ensure data changes upstream of dbt or within a project's logic don't break downstream consumers' data products.


## When is the right time to use dbt Mesh?[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-1-intro?version=1.12#when-is-the-right-time-to-use-dbt-mesh "Direct link to When is the right time to use dbt Mesh?")
The multi-project architecture helps organizations with mature, complex transformation workflows in dbt increase the flexibility and performance of their dbt projects. If you're already using dbt and your project has started to experience any of the following, you're likely ready to start exploring this paradigm:
  * The **number of models** in your project is degrading performance and slowing down development.
  * Teams have developed **separate workflows** and need to decouple development from each other.
  * Teams are experiencing **communication challenges** , and the reliability of some of your data products has started to deteriorate.
  * **Security and governance** requirements are increasing and would benefit from increased isolation.


dbt is designed to coordinate the features above and simplify the complexity to solve for these problems.
If you're just starting your dbt journey, don't worry about building a multi-project architecture right away. You can _incrementally_ adopt the features in this guide as you scale. The collection of features work effectively as independent tools. Familiarizing yourself with the tooling and features that make up a multi-project architecture, and how they can apply to your organization will help you make better decisions as you grow.
For additional information, refer to the [Mesh FAQs](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-5-faqs).
## Learning goals[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-1-intro?version=1.12#learning-goals "Direct link to Learning goals")
  * Understand the **purpose and tradeoffs** of building a multi-project architecture.
  * Develop an intuition for various **Mesh patterns** and how to design a multi-project architecture for your organization.
  * Establish recommended steps to **incrementally adopt** these patterns in your dbt implementation.

On this page
This page uses Snowflake for code examples, but you can adapt the views-only pattern to other warehouses.
For some workloads, the simplest and most "real-time" pattern is to materialize everything as views on top of a continuously updated source table. When transformations are very lightweight and the source is already being updated in near real-time, this can preserve the source's latency almost perfectly.
## When to use the views-only pattern[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#when-to-use-the-views-only-pattern "Direct link to When to use the views-only pattern")
Use this when:
  * Source freshness is already "good enough" (for example, ingestion service or operational system writes into a warehouse table every few seconds or minutes).
  * You have very lightweight transformations, such as:
    * Simple projections / renames
    * One to two joins to small reference table
    * Minimal or no heavy aggregations or window functions
  * You care most about preserving the source table's latency and are willing to trade off some query performance at read time.
  * This works best for small-to-medium tables with simple queries.


Typical examples:
  * Dashboards showing current system status (like active user sessions, current queue depth, or recent device heartbeats) where you need to see the latest data immediately.
  * Event data that you're forwarding to other tools with minimal transformation (raw data with just a bit of normalization, like cleaning up field names or adding a few reference fields).


If your transform logic becomes heavier, multiple teams depend on the data, or you need better cost and performance control, transition to [incremental models](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns) or [dynamic tables/materialized views](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/3-warehouse-native-features). Reserve this pattern for the smallest, most latency‑sensitive use cases.
#### Assumptions[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#assumptions "Direct link to Assumptions")
The examples used in this page assume the following setup:
  * A non‑dbt system (ETL, streaming pipeline, app) is already writing into a warehouse‑resident table such as `raw.realtime_events` or `ops.active_sessions`, and that table meets your service level agreement for latency.
  * Querying that table directly is acceptable from a performance and cost standpoint for your expected concurrency.
  * You don't need dbt to persist intermediate tables; you mainly care about:
    * Consistent SQL logic (column naming, type casting)
    * Tests, contracts, and lineage
    * Exposures to BI / downstream tools


All dbt models in this path are materialized as views, not tables or incremental models.
## Example implementation[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#example-implementation "Direct link to Example implementation")
Here's an example implementation of the views-only pattern, which has the following pattern structure:
  * [Source table](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#source-table-definition) (continuously updated): `raw.realtime_events`
  * [Thin staging view](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#staging-view): `analytics.stg_realtime_events_v`
  * [Domain view(s)](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#domain-view-definition): `analytics.vw_realtime_events_enriched`


### Source table definition[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#source-table-definition "Direct link to Source table definition")
```
# models/sources.ymlversion:2sources:-name: rawschema: rawtables:-name: realtime_eventsdescription:"Continuously updated event table from streaming pipeline."loaded_at_field: event_ts
```

### Staging view[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#staging-view "Direct link to Staging view")
```
-- models/staging/stg_realtime_events.sql{{ config(    materialized ='view'select    event_id,    event_ts::timestamp_ntz   as event_ts,-- Snowflake syntax for type casting    to_date(event_ts)as event_date,    user_id,    event_type,    payloadfrom {{ source('raw','realtime_events') }};
```

### Domain view definition[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#domain-view-definition "Direct link to Domain view definition")
```
-- models/marts/vw_realtime_events_enriched.sql{{ config(    materialized ='view'with base as(select*from {{ ref('stg_realtime_events') }}user_dim as(select        user_id,        user_segment,        signup_datefrom {{ ref('dim_user') }}   -- can be a table or incremental modelselect.event_id,.event_ts,.event_date,.user_id,.user_segment,.event_type,.payloadfrom base as bleftjoin user_dim as uon b.user_id = u.user_id;
```

Downstream tools query `analytics.vw_realtime_events_enriched`. As long as `raw.realtime_events` is continuously updated, this view stack is as fresh as the source.
## Benefits[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#benefits "Direct link to Benefits")
  * Maximum freshness: The view reflects new data as soon as it lands in `raw.realtime_events`.
  * Simple operations: No incremental logic to tune and no extra dbt job needed just to keep the data fresh. You still schedule jobs for tests, docs, and so on.
  * Best for small datasets: Works well when tables are small and queries are simple. Computing the view on the fly is cheap and fast.


## Limitations and risks[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#limitations-and-risks "Direct link to Limitations and risks")
This pattern is only safe under tight constraints and has several important limitations:
  * [Doesn't scale to heavy transformations](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#doesnt-scale-to-heavy-transformations)
  * [No "frozen" intermediate tables](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#no-frozen-intermediate-tables)
  * [Schema change sensitivity](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#schema-change-sensitivity)
  * [Potential impact on operational systems](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#potential-impact-on-operational-systems)


### Doesn't scale to heavy transformations[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#doesnt-scale-to-heavy-transformations "Direct link to Doesn't scale to heavy transformations")
If your logic evolves into large joins, deep view chains, or expensive aggregations, you'll quickly run into performance issues:
  * Every query must re‑execute all the logic.
  * The warehouse has to optimize and execute the full stack of views every time.


In those cases, use either of the following:
  * [Dynamic tables or materialized views](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/3-warehouse-native-features), where appropriate


### No "frozen" intermediate tables[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#no-frozen-intermediate-tables "Direct link to No "frozen" intermediate tables")
Because everything is a view:
  * There's no persisted intermediate layer to debug or profile.
  * You can't easily "rerun yesterday's logic" if upstream data changes—everything always reflects the current state.


### Schema change sensitivity[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#schema-change-sensitivity "Direct link to Schema change sensitivity")
Schema changes in the source table propagate immediately through the view stack, which:
  * Can break downstream BI if columns are dropped or types change.
  * Make tests and model contracts more important, since there’s no batch boundary to catch issues before users see them.


### Potential impact on operational systems[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#potential-impact-on-operational-systems "Direct link to Potential impact on operational systems")
If the continuously‑updated source is itself a live operational store (not a warehouse landing table), you must be careful not to overload it with analytics queries. In most cases, it is recommended to:
  1. Replicate into a warehouse table first (Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, and so on).
  2. Apply this views‑only pattern within the warehouse, not directly on the Online Transaction Processing system.

Note that this best practices guide doesn't yet use the [new YAML specification](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/latest-metrics-spec). We're working on updating this guide to use the new spec and file structure soon!
To read more about the new spec, see [Creating metrics](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/metrics-overview).
## How to build metrics[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-4-build-metrics?version=1.12#how-to-build-metrics "Direct link to How to build metrics")
  * 💹 We'll start with one of the most important metrics for any business: **revenue**.
  * 📖 For now, our metric for revenue will be **defined as the sum of order totals excluding tax**.


## Defining revenue[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-4-build-metrics?version=1.12#defining-revenue "Direct link to Defining revenue")
  * 🔢 Metrics have four basic properties:
    * `name:` We'll use 'revenue' to reference this metric.
    * `description:` For documentation.
    * `label:` The display name for the metric in downstream tools.
    * `type:` one of `simple`, `ratio`, or `derived`.
  * 🎛️ Each type has different `type_params`.
  * 🛠️ We'll build a **simple metric** first to get the hang of it, and move on to ratio and derived metrics later.
  * 📏 Simple metrics are built on a **single measure defined as a type parameter**.
  * 🔜 Defining **measures as their own distinct component** on semantic models is critical to allowing the **flexibility of more advanced metrics** , though simple metrics act mainly as **pass-through that provide filtering** and labeling options.


models/marts/orders.yml
```
metrics:-name: revenuedescription: Sum of the order total.label: Revenuetype: simpletype_params:measure: order_total
```

## Query your metric[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-4-build-metrics?version=1.12#query-your-metric "Direct link to Query your metric")
You can use the dbt CLI for metric validation or queries during development, via the `dbt sl` set of subcommands. Here are some useful examples:
```
dbt sl query revenue --group-by metric_time__monthdbt sl list dimensions --metrics revenue # list all dimensions available for the revenue metric
```

  * It's best practice any time we're updating our Semantic Layer code to run `dbt parse` to update our development semantic manifest.
  * `dbt sl query` is not how you would typically use the tool in production, that's handled by the dbt Semantic Layer's features. It's available for testing results of various metric queries in development, exactly as we're using it now.
  * Note the structure of the above query. We select the metric(s) we want and the dimensions to group them by — we use dunders (double underscores e.g.`metric_time__[time bucket]`) to designate time dimensions or other non-unique dimensions that need a specified entity path to resolve (e.g. if you have an orders location dimension and an employee location dimension both named 'location' you would need dunders to specify `orders__location` or `employee__location`).

## How to build a semantic model[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-3-build-semantic-models?version=1.12#how-to-build-a-semantic-model "Direct link to How to build a semantic model")
A semantic model is the Semantic Layer equivalent to a logical layer model (what historically has just been called a 'model' in dbt land). Just as configurations for models are defined on the `models:` YAML key, configurations for semantic models are housed under `semantic models:`. A key difference is that while a logical model consists of configuration and SQL or Python code, a **semantic model is defined purely via YAML**. Rather than encoding a specific dataset, a **semantic model describes relationships and expressions** that let your end users select and refine their own datasets dynamically and reliably.
  * ⚙️ Semantic models are **comprised of three components** :
    * 🫂 **entities** : these describe the **relationships** between various semantic models (think ids)
    * 🔪 **dimensions** : these are the columns you want to **slice, dice, group, and filter by** (think timestamps, categories, booleans).
    * 📏 **measures** : these are the **quantitative values you want to aggregate**
  * 🪣 We define **columns as being an entity, dimension, or measure**. Columns will typically fit into one of these 3 buckets, or if they're a complex aggregation expression, they might constitute a metric.


## Defining orders[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-3-build-semantic-models?version=1.12#defining-orders "Direct link to Defining orders")
Let's zoom in on how we might define an _orders_ semantic model.
  * 📗 We define it as a **YAML dictionary in the`semantic_models` list**.
  * 📑 It will have a **name, entities list, dimensions list, and measures list**.
  * ⏬ We recommend defining them **in this order consistently** as a style best practice.


models/marts/orders.yml
```
semantic_models:-name: ordersentities:...# we'll define these laterdimensions:...# we'll define these latermeasures:...# we'll define these later
```

  * Next we'll point to the corresponding logical model by supplying a [`ref`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/ref) in the `model:` property, and a `description` for documentation.


models/marts/orders.yml
```
semantic_models:-name: ordersdescription:|      Model containing order data. The grain of the table is the order id.model: ref('stg_orders')entities:...dimensions:...measures:...
```

## Establishing our entities[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-3-build-semantic-models?version=1.12#establishing-our-entities "Direct link to Establishing our entities")
  * 🫂 Entities are the **objects and concepts** in our data that _have_ dimensions and measures. You can think of them as the **nouns** of our project, the **spines** of our queries that we may want to aggregate by, or simply the **join keys**.
  * 🔀 Entities help MetricFlow understand **how various semantic models relate to one another**.
  * ⛓️ Unlike many other semantic layers, in MetricFlow **we do not need to describe joins explicitly** , instead the **relationships are implicitly described by entities**.
  * 1️⃣ Each semantic model should have **one primary entity** defined for itself, and **any number of foreign entities** for other semantic models it may join to.
  * 🫂 Entities require a **name and type**
    * 🔑 Types available are **primary** , **foreign** , **unique** or **natural** — we'll be focused on the first two for now, but you can [read more about unique and natural keys](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/entities#entity-types).


### Entities in action[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-3-build-semantic-models?version=1.12#entities-in-action "Direct link to Entities in action")
If we look at an example staging model for orders, we see that it has 3 id columns, so we'll need three entities.
models/staging/stg_orders.sql
```
renamed as(select----------  idsas order_id,        store_id as location_id,        customer as customer_id,---------- properties(order_total /100.0)as order_total,(tax_paid /100.0)as tax_paid,---------- timestamps        ordered_atfrom source
```

  * 👉 We add them with a **`name`,`type` , and optional `expr`** (expression). The expression can be any valid SQL expression on your platform.
  * 📛 If you **don't add an expression** , MetricFlow will **assume the name is equal to the column name** in the underlying logical model.
  * 👍 Our best practices pattern is to, whenever possible, provide a `name` that is the singular form of the subject or grain of the table, and use `expr` to specify the precise column name (with `_id` etc). This will let us write **more readable metrics** on top of these semantic models. For example, we'll use `location` instead of `location_id`.


models/marts/orders.yml
```
semantic_models:-name: ordersentities:# we use the column for the name here because order is a reserved word in SQL-name: order_idtype: primary-name: locationtype: foreignexpr: location_id-name: customertype: foreignexpr: customer_iddimensions:measures:
```

## Defining our dimensions[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-3-build-semantic-models?version=1.12#defining-our-dimensions "Direct link to Defining our dimensions")
  * 🧮 Dimensions are the columns that we want to **filter and group by** , **the adjectives of our project**. They come in three types:
    * **categorical**
    * **time**
    * slowly changing dimensions — [these are covered in the documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/dimensions#scd-type-ii), and a little more complex. To focus on building your mental models of MetricFlow's fundamentals, we won't be using SCDs in this guide.
  * ➕ We're **not limited to existing columns** , we can use the `expr` property to add simple computations in our dimensions.
  * 📛 Categorical dimensions are the simplest, they simply require a `name` and `type` (type being categorical). **If the`name` property matches the name of the dimension column**, that's it, you're done. If you want or need to use a `name` other than the column name, or do some filtering or computation, **you can supply an optional`expr` property** to evaluate for the dimension.


### Dimensions in action[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-3-build-semantic-models?version=1.12#dimensions-in-action "Direct link to Dimensions in action")
  * 👀 Let's look at our staging model again and see what fields we have available.


models/staging/stg_orders.sql
```
select----------  ids -> entities    id as order_id,    store_id as location_id,    customer as customer_id,---------- numerics -> measures(order_total /100.0)as order_total,(tax_paid /100.0)as tax_paid,---------- timestamps -> dimensions    ordered_atfrom source
```

  * ⏰ For now the only dimension to add is a **time dimension** : `ordered_at`.
  * 🕰️ At least one **primary time dimension** is **required** for any semantic models that **have measures**.
  * 1️⃣ We denote this with the `is_primary` property, or if there is only a one-time dimension supplied it is primary by default. Below we only have `ordered_at` as a timestamp so we don't need to specify anything except the _minimum granularity_ we're bucketing to (in this case, day). By this we mean that we're not going to be looking at orders at a finer granularity than a day.


models/marts/orders.yml
```
dimensions:-name: ordered_atexpr: date_trunc('day', ordered_at)type: timetype_params:time_granularity: day
```

**Dimensional models**. You may have some models that do not contain measures, just dimensional data that enriches other facts. That's totally fine, a semantic model does not require dimensions or measures, it just needs a primary entity, and if you do have measures, a primary time dimension.
We'll discuss an alternate situation, dimensional tables that have static numeric values like supply costs or tax rates but no time dimensions, later in the Guide.
  * 🔢 We can also **make a dimension out of a numeric column** that would typically be a measure.
  * 🪣 Using `expr` we can **create buckets of values that we label** for our dimension. We'll add one of these in for labeling 'large orders' as any order totals over $50.


models/marts/orders.yml
```
dimensions:-name: ordered_atexpr: date_trunc('day', ordered_at)type: timetype_params:time_granularity: day-name: is_large_ordertype: categoricalexpr: case when order_total  50 then true else false end
```

## Making our measures[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-3-build-semantic-models?version=1.12#making-our-measures "Direct link to Making our measures")
  * 📏 Measures are the final component of a semantic model. They describe the **numeric values that we want to aggregate**.
  * 🧱 Measures form **the building blocks of metrics** , with entities and dimensions helping us combine, group, and filter those metrics correctly.
  * 🏃 You can think of them as something like the **verbs of a semantic model**.


### Measures in action[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-3-build-semantic-models?version=1.12#measures-in-action "Direct link to Measures in action")
  * 👀 Let's look at **our staging model** one last time and see what **fields we want to measure**.


models/staging/stg_orders.sql
```
select----------  ids -> entities    id as order_id,    store_id as location_id,    customer as customer_id,---------- numerics -> measures(order_total /100.0)as order_total,(tax_paid /100.0)as tax_paid,---------- timestamps -> dimensions    ordered_atfrom source
```

  * ➕ Here `order_total` and `tax paid` are the **columns we want as measures**.
  * 📝 We can describe them via the code below, specifying a **name, description, aggregation, and expression**.
  * 👍 As before MetricFlow will default to the **name being the name of a column when no expression is supplied**.
  * 🧮 [Many different aggregations](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/measures#aggregation) are available to us. Here we just want sums.


models/marts/orders.yml
```
measures:-name: order_totaldescription: The total amount for each order including taxes.agg: sum-name: tax_paiddescription: The total tax paid on each order.agg: sum
```

  * 🆕 We can also **create new measures using expressions** , for instance adding a count of individual orders as below.


models/marts/orders.yml
```
-name: order_countdescription: The count of individual orders.expr:1agg: sum
```

## Reviewing our work[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-3-build-semantic-models?version=1.12#reviewing-our-work "Direct link to Reviewing our work")
Our completed code will look like this, our first semantic model! Here are two examples showing different organizational approaches:
Co-located approach
models/marts/orders.yml
```
semantic_models:-name: ordersdefaults:agg_time_dimension: ordered_atdescription:|      Order fact table. This table is at the order grain with one row per order.model: ref('stg_orders')entities:-name: order_idtype: primary-name: locationtype: foreignexpr: location_id-name: customertype: foreignexpr: customer_iddimensions:-name: ordered_atexpr: date_trunc('day', ordered_at)# use date_trunc(ordered_at, DAY) if using BigQuerytype: timetype_params:time_granularity: day-name: is_large_ordertype: categoricalexpr: case when order_total  50 then true else false endmeasures:-name: order_totaldescription: The total revenue for each order.agg: sum-name: order_countdescription: The count of individual orders.agg: sum-name: tax_paiddescription: The total tax paid on each order.agg: sum
```

Parallel sub-folder approach
models/semantic_models/sem_orders.yml
```
semantic_models:-name: ordersdefaults:agg_time_dimension: ordered_atdescription:|      Order fact table. This table is at the order grain with one row per order.model: ref('stg_orders')entities:-name: order_idtype: primary-name: locationtype: foreignexpr: location_id-name: customertype: foreignexpr: customer_iddimensions:-name: ordered_atexpr: date_trunc('day', ordered_at)# use date_trunc(ordered_at, DAY) if using BigQuerytype: timetype_params:time_granularity: day-name: is_large_ordertype: categoricalexpr: case when order_total  50 then true else false endmeasures:-name: order_totaldescription: The total revenue for each order.agg: sum-name: order_countdescription: The count of individual orders.agg: sum-name: tax_paiddescription: The total tax paid on each order.agg: sum
```

As you can see, the content of the semantic model is identical in both approaches. The key differences are:
  1. **File location**
     * Co-located approach: `models/marts/orders.yml`
     * Parallel sub-folder approach: `models/semantic_models/sem_orders.yml`
  2. **File naming**
     * Co-located approach: Uses the same name as the corresponding mart (`orders.yml`)
     * Parallel sub-folder approach: Prefixes the file with `sem_` (`sem_orders.yml`)


Choose the approach that best fits your project structure and team preferences. The co-located approach is often simpler for new projects, while the parallel sub-folder approach can be clearer for migrating large existing projects to the Semantic Layer.
## Next steps[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-3-build-semantic-models?version=1.12#next-steps "Direct link to Next steps")
Let's review the basics of semantic models:
  * 🧱 Consist of **entities, dimensions, and measures**.
  * 🫂 Describe the **semantics and relationships of objects** in the warehouse.
  * 1️⃣ Correspond to a **single logical model** in your dbt project.


Next up, let's use our new semantic model to **build a metric**!

On this page
## Getting started[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-2-setup?version=1.12#getting-started "Direct link to Getting started")
There are two options for developing a dbt project, including the Semantic Layer:
  * [dbt CLI](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/cloud-cli-installation) — MetricFlow commands are embedded in the dbt CLI under the `dbt sl` subcommand. This is the easiest, most full-featured way to develop Semantic Layer code for the time being. You can use the editor of your choice and run commands from the terminal.
  * [Studio IDE](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/studio-ide/develop-in-studio) — You can create semantic models and metrics in the Studio IDE.


## Basic commands[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-2-setup?version=1.12#basic-commands "Direct link to Basic commands")
  * 🔍 A less common command that will come in handy with the Semantic Layer is `dbt parse`. This will parse your project and generate a **semantic manifest** , a representation of meaningful connections described by your project. This is uploaded to dbt, and used for running `dbt sl` commands in development. This file gives MetricFlow a **state of the world from which to generate queries**.
  * 🧰 `dbt sl query` is your other best friend, it will execute a query against your semantic layer and return a sample of the results. This is great for testing your semantic models and metrics as you build them. For example, if you're building a revenue model you can run `dbt sl query --metrics revenue --group-by metric_time__month` to validate that monthly revenue is calculating correctly.
  * 📝 Lastly, `dbt sl list dimensions --metrics [metric name]` will list all the dimensions available for a given metric. This is useful for checking that you're increasing dimensionality as you progress. You can `dbt sl list` other aspects of your Semantic Layer as well, run `dbt sl list --help` for the full list of options.


For more information on the available commands, refer to the [MetricFlow commands](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/metricflow-commands) reference, or use `dbt sl --help` and `dbt sl [subcommand] --help` on the command line. If you need to set up a dbt project first, check out the [quickstart guides](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/get-started-dbt).
## Onward![​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-2-setup?version=1.12#onward "Direct link to Onward!")
Throughout the rest of the guide, we'll show example code based on the Jaffle Shop project, a fictional chain of restaurants. You can check out the code yourself and try things out in the [Jaffle Shop repository](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle-shop). So if you see us calculating metrics like `food_revenue` later in this guide, this is why!

On this page
This section covers three core incremental patterns for achieving near real-time data freshness:
  1. [Incremental MERGE from append-only tables](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#incremental-merge-from-append-only-tables)
  2. [CDC with Snowflake Streams](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#cdc-with-snowflake-streams)
  3. [Microbatch for large time-series tables](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#microbatch-for-large-time-series-tables)


Some patterns on this guide uses Snowflake-specific features. Other warehouses have similar features with different implementations. Refer to the [additional resources](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/3-warehouse-native-features#resources-by-warehouse) section for adapter-specific documentation.
## Pattern 1: Incremental MERGE from append-only tables[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#incremental-merge-from-append-only-tables "Direct link to Pattern 1: Incremental MERGE from append-only tables")
This pattern uses the `merge` incremental strategy to upsert (insert + update) new and updated rows into a target table. Most data platforms support the `merge` strategy. See the [supported incremental strategies by adapter](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-strategy#supported-incremental-strategies-by-adapter) for details.
"Append-only tables" refers to a data pattern where source data continuously receives new rows without updates or deletes.
### When to use the merge strategy[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#when-to-use-the-merge-strategy "Direct link to When to use the merge strategy")
Use this pattern when raw events continuously land into a staging table and you want a near real-time fact table updated every few minutes.
### Example model[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#example-model "Direct link to Example model")
In this example, assume you have raw events continuously landing into `raw.events` (using Snowpipe, Databricks Auto Loader, Kafka, or a similar ingestion mechanism) and you're looking for a near real‑time fact table `analytics.fct_events` updated every few minutes.
Configure the SQL model with the following settings:
  * Use the `incremental` filter to only scan rows newer than the latest timestamp already in the target.
  * Use `incremental_strategy='merge'` with `unique_key=event_id` to give you idempotent upserts (inserts + updates).
  * Cluster by date using `cluster_by=['event_date']` helps with query pruning during `MERGE` operations (syntax varies by warehouse).
  * Run the model every few minutes to achieve a freshness service level agreement (SLA) measured in minutes, depending on ingestion and job scheduling.


The following example uses Snowflake SQL syntax (`::` type casting, `timestamp_ntz`, `cluster_by` config). Make sure you adapt the SQL and clustering syntax for your warehouse.
models/fct_events.sql
```
{{ config(    materialized ='incremental',    incremental_strategy ='merge',-- default on Snowflake    unique_key ='event_id',    cluster_by =['event_date']-- helps MERGE performance (syntax varies by warehouse)with source_events as(select        event_id,        event_ts::timestamp_ntz       as event_ts,-- Snowflake syntax for type casting        to_date(event_ts)as event_date,        user_id,        event_type,        payloadfrom {{ source('raw','events') }}%if is_incremental()%} -- Only pull new/changed rows since last successful loadwhere event_ts (selectmax(event_ts)from {{ this }})% endif %}deduped as(-- optional: if the raw feed can produce duplicatesselect*select            row_number()over(partitionby event_idorderby event_ts desc)as _rnfrom source_eventswhere _rn =1select    event_id,    event_ts,    event_date,    user_id,    event_type,    payloadfrom deduped;
```

To ensure the best results:
  * Use clustering keys wisely for better `MERGE` performance.
  * Monitor `MERGE` performance as your table grows.
  * Consider adding a lookback window (for example, `event_ts > max(event_ts) - interval '1 hour'`) to handle late-arriving data.


## Pattern 2: CDC with Snowflake Streams[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#cdc-with-snowflake-streams "Direct link to Pattern 2: CDC with Snowflake Streams")
This pattern leverages Snowflake's native Change Data Capture (CDC) capabilities through [Streams](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/streams-intro), a Snowflake-specific feature which tracks changes (inserts, updates, deletes) to source tables.
### When to use CDC[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#when-to-use-cdc "Direct link to When to use CDC")
Use CDC when:
  * You have source tables that receive frequent updates (not just appends).
  * You need to capture both new records and changes to existing records.
  * You want to avoid full table scans on large source tables.


### Setup[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#setup "Direct link to Setup")
To use this pattern, set up the stream in your data warehouse and then create a model to consume the stream.
  1. Create the stream (one-time, outside dbt):


```
createorreplace stream RAW.EVENTS_STREAMontable RAW.EVENTS;
```

  1. Create a model consuming the stream:


models/fct_events_cdc.sql
```
{{ config(    materialized ='incremental',    incremental_strategy ='merge',    unique_key ='event_id',    cluster_by =['event_date'],    snowflake_warehouse ='TRANSFORM_WH'with changes as(select        event_id,        event_ts::timestamp_ntz        as event_ts,        to_date(event_ts)as event_date,        user_id,        event_type,        payload,        metadata$actionas change_type-- points at the STREAM, not the tablefrom {{ source('raw','events_stream') }}filtered as(select*from changeswhere change_type in('INSERT','UPDATE')-- If you want to physically delete, you could also handle 'DELETE' hereselect    event_id,    event_ts,    event_date,    user_id,    event_type,    payloadfrom filtered;
```

### Pattern distinctions[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#pattern-distinctions "Direct link to Pattern distinctions")
There are some key differences from [pattern 1](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#incremental-merge-from-append-only-tables):
  * Streams only return changed rows, so you don’t need an `is_incremental()` time filter. Each run processes only the changes available at the moment.
  * Run the model every few minutes to pull new changes and merge them into `fct_events`.
  * This gives you a CDC-style pipeline. Snowflake Streams captures changes, and dbt handles transformations, tests, and lineage.


## Pattern 3: Microbatch for large time-series tables[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#microbatch-for-large-time-series-tables "Direct link to Pattern 3: Microbatch for large time-series tables")
For large `fact` tables where backfills or long lookback windows are challenging, use `incremental_strategy='microbatch'` (available in dbt Core v1.9 or higher and Latest release track in dbt platform). Refer to [incremental microbatch](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-microbatch) for more details. Note that Microsoft Fabric doesn't support microbatch yet. See [incremental strategy by adapter](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-strategy#supported-incremental-strategies-by-adapter) for more details.
Every upstream model feeding this microbatch model must also be configured with `event_time` so dbt can push time-filters upstream. Otherwise, each batch could re-scan full upstream tables.
### When to use microbatch[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#when-to-use-microbatch "Direct link to When to use microbatch")
  * You have massive time-series tables (billions of rows).
  * Backfills are slow and risky with traditional incremental approaches.
  * You need to reprocess data in manageable chunks.
  * Late-arriving data is common.


### Model configuration[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#model-configuration "Direct link to Model configuration")
Let's say you have a `fact_events` table with a `event_ts` column and you want to process it in hourly chunks. You can configure the model as follows:
models/fct_events_microbatch.sql
```
{{ config(    materialized        ='incremental',    incremental_strategy='microbatch',    event_time          ='event_ts',-- time column in this model    batch_size          ='hour',-- process in hourly chunks    lookback            =1,-- reprocess 1 prior batch to catch late data    unique_key          ='event_id',    cluster_by          =['event_date'],    full_refresh        =falseselect    event_id,    event_ts::timestamp_ntz   as event_ts,    to_date(event_ts)as event_date,    user_id,    event_type,    payloadfrom {{ ref('stg_events') }};
```

### Key behavior[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#key-behavior "Direct link to Key behavior")
  * Use microbatch for massive fact tables (clickstream, IoT, point-of-sale) with multi-year history.
  * No `is_incremental() block` needed — dbt automatically generates the appropriate `WHERE event_ts BETWEEN..` predicates per batch based on `event_time`, `batch_size`, `begin`, `lookback`, and so on.
  * Each run processes multiple smaller queries (one per batch), making larger backfills safer and easier to retry.
  * The `lookback` parameter automatically handles late-arriving data by reprocessing recent batches.
  * Schedule jobs based on your SLA.


## Choosing the right incremental pattern[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#choosing-the-right-incremental-pattern "Direct link to Choosing the right incremental pattern")
The pattern you select will depend on your use case. Start with [pattern 1](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#incremental-merge-from-append-only-tables) (`MERGE`), since it's appropriate for most use cases. Upgrade to [pattern 2](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#cdc-with-snowflake-streams) (use your data warehouse's native CDC features) when you need efficient CDC. Reach for [pattern 3](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#microbatch-for-large-time-series-tables) (Microbatch) when dealing with massive scale.
Use the following table to help you choose the right pattern:
Pattern | Best for | Key benefit
---|---|---
`merge` from append-only | Most standard use cases | Simple, widely understood
CDC with Streams | Tables with frequent updates | Efficient change capture
Microbatch | Massive time-series tables | Safe backfills, late-data handling
Pattern |  Best for |  Key benefit
---|---|---
`merge` from append-only | Most standard use cases | Simple, widely understood
CDC with Streams | Tables with frequent updates | Efficient change capture
Microbatch | Massive time-series tables | Safe backfills, late-data handling

Coordinating model versions across your mesh is a critical part of the model versioning process. This guide will walk you through the safe best practices for coordinating producers and consumers when introducing model versions.
An important part of our dbt Mesh workflow is [model versions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/model-versions). This enables better data model management and is critical in a scenario where multiple teams share models across projects.
Releasing a new model version safely requires coordination between model producers (who build the models) and model consumers (who depend on them).
This guide goes over the following topics:
  * [How producers introduce new model versions safely](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#best-practices-for-producers)
  * [How consumers evaluate and migrate to those new versions](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#best-practices-for-consumers)


For how versioning works at a technical level (YAML structure, contracts, aliasing), see [model versions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/model-versions).
## Best practices for producers[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#best-practices-for-producers "Direct link to Best practices for producers")
Producers own the creation, rollout, communication, and deprecation of model versions. The following steps go over what producers should do when introducing a new version of a model.
  * [Step 1: Decide when a change needs a new version](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#step-1-decide-when-a-changes-needs-a-new-version)
  * [Step 2: Create the new version safely](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#step-2-create-the-new-version-safely)
  * [Step 3: Add a deprecation date](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#step-3-add-a-deprecation-date)
  * [Step 4: Communicate the new version](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#step-4-communicate-the-new-version)
  * [Step 5: Remove the old version](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#step-5-remove-the-old-version)
  * [Step 6: Clean up deprecated versions](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#step-6-clean-up-deprecated-versions)


#### Step 1: Decide when a change needs a new version[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#step-1-decide-when-a-change-needs-a-new-version "Direct link to Step 1: Decide when a change needs a new version")
When creating an original version of a model, use [model contracts](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/model-contracts) to ensure that breaking changes produce errors during development. The model contract ensures you, as a producer, are not changing the shape or data type of the output model. If a change breaks the contract, like removing or changing a column type, this means you should create a new model contract, and thus a new model version.
Here are some examples of breaking changes that might need a new version:
  * Removing a column
  * Renaming a column
  * Changing a column type


Here are some examples of non-breaking changes:
  * Adding a new column
  * Fixing a bug in an existing column


Here are examples of changes that might be breaking depending on your business logic:
  * Changing logic behind a metric
  * Changing granularity
  * Modifying filters
  * Rewriting `CASE` statements


#### Step 2: Create the new version safely[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#step-2-create-the-new-version-safely "Direct link to Step 2: Create the new version safely")
After deciding that a change needs a new [version](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/versions), follow these steps to create the new version without disrupting existing workflows. Let's say you're removing a column:
  1. Create a new version of the model file. For example, `fishtown_analytics_orders_v2.sql`. Each version of a model must have its own SQL file.
  2. Keep the default version stable. In the model's `properties.yml` file:
     * Set [`versions`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/versions) to include the old version and the new version: `- v: 1` and `- v: 2` respectively.
     * Set the [`latest_version:`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/latest_version) to `latest_version: 1`.
This ensures that downstream consumers using `ref(...)` won’t accidentally start using v2. Without setting this, the default will be the highest numerical version, which could be a breaking change for consumers.
  3. Set an [alias](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/alias) or create a view over the latest model version. By aliasing or creating a view over the latest model version, you ensure `fishtown_analytics_orders` (without the version suffix) always exists as an object in the warehouse, pointing to the latest version. This also protects external tools and BI dashboards.


#### Step 3: Add a deprecation date[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#step-3-add-a-deprecation-date "Direct link to Step 3: Add a deprecation date")
  1. In the model's `properties.yml` file, set a [`deprecation_date`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/deprecation_date) for the model's old version. The `deprecation_date` is a date in the future that signifies when the old version will be removed.
This notifies downstream consumers and will appear in the `dbt run` logs as a warning that the old version is nearing deprecation and consumers will need to [migrate](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#best-practices-for-consumers) to the new version.
If your model has an [enforced contract](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/model-contracts), you cannot delete the model until after the `deprecation_date` has passed. dbt doesn't allow deleting models with enforced contracts before their `deprecation_date` to protect downstream consumers.
If you try to delete a versioned model before its `deprecation_date`, dbt will raise an error during development runs and cause jobs to fail.
models/properties.yml
```
models:-name: fishtown_analytics_orderslatest_version:1columns:-name: column_to_remove-name: column_to_keepversions:-v:1# old version — uses all top-level columnsdeprecation_date:"2025-12-31"-v:2# new versioncolumns:-include: allexclude:[column_to_remove]# <— specify which columns were removed in v2
```

  2. Merge the new version into the main branch.
  3. Run the job to build the new version.
  4. Verify that the new version builds successfully.
  5. Verify that the deprecation date is set correctly in the `dbt run` logs.


If you try to reference models (for example, `{{ ref('upstream_project', 'model_name', v=1) }}`) using the `v=1` argument after the deprecation date, the `ref` call will fail once the producer project removes the `v1` version.
#### Step 4: Communicate the new version[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#step-4-communicate-the-new-version "Direct link to Step 4: Communicate the new version")
After creating a new version and setting a deprecation date for the old version, communicate the new version to downstream consumers. Let them know that:
  * A new version is available and a deprecation timeline exists.
  * Consumers can test the new version and [migrate](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#best-practices-for-consumers) over.
  * To test the new version, consumers can use `v=2` when referencing the model. For example, `{{ ref('upstream_project', 'model_name', v=2) }}`.


#### Step 5: Remove the old version[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#step-5-remove-the-old-version "Direct link to Step 5: Remove the old version")
Once the consumers confirm they've tested and migrated over to the new version, you can set the new version as the latest version:
models/properties.yml
```
models:-name: fishtown_analytics_orderslatest_version:2# update from 1 to 2 to set the new version as the latest versionversions:-v:1# this represents the old version-v:2# this represents the new version
```

This then updates the default `ref` to the new version. For example, `{{ ref('upstream_project', 'fishtown_analytics_orders') }}` will now resolve to the `fishtown_analytics_orders_v2` model in the `upstream_project`. If consumers want to use the old version, they can use `v=1` when referencing the model: `{{ ref('upstream_project', 'fishtown_analytics_orders', v=1) }}`.
#### Step 6: Clean up deprecated versions[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#step-6-clean-up-deprecated-versions "Direct link to Step 6: Clean up deprecated versions")
After all consumers have [migrated](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#best-practices-for-consumers) to the new version, you can clean up the deprecated version. You could choose to "hard delete" all old versions, or "soft delete" them for continuity.
If your model has an [enforced contract](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/model-contracts), you cannot delete the model until after the `deprecation_date` has passed. dbt doesn't allow deleting models with enforced contracts before their `deprecation_date` to protect downstream consumers.
If you try to delete a versioned model before its `deprecation_date`, dbt will raise an error during development runs and cause jobs to fail.
  * Hard delete (cleanest)
  * Soft delete (retains continuity)


"Hard deleting" old versions is the cleanest approach and removes all old version artifacts from your project:
  1. Delete the `fishtown_analytics_orders_v1.sql` file and rename the new version back to `fishtown_analytics_orders.sql`.
  2. Delete all version specifications from your `.yml` file.
  3. Drop or delete the `fishtown_analytics_orders_v1` object from your warehouse with a manual script or using a cleanup macro.


"Soft deleting" old versions retains all old version artifacts to avoid confusion if more model versions get introduced in future, and for continuity. Bear in mind that your version control platform will also have the history of all of these changes.
  1. Repoint the `fishtown_analytics_orders` alias to your latest version file (for example, `fishtown_analytics_orders_v2`), or create a view on top of the latest model version.
  2. Use the `enabled` [config option](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/enabled) to disable the deprecated model version so that it doesn’t run in dbt jobs and can’t be referenced in a cross-project ref. For example:
models/properties.yml
```
models:-name: fishtown_analytics_orderslatest_version:1columns:-name: column_to_remove-name: column_to_keepversions:-v:1# old version — uses all top-level columnsdeprecation_date:"2025-12-31"config:enabled:false#  disable deprecated version so it no longer runs-v:2# new versioncolumns:-include: allexclude:[column_to_remove]# <— specify which columns were removed in v2
```

  3. Drop or delete the `fishtown_analytics_orders_v1` object from your warehouse with a manual script or appropriate process or using a cleanup macro.


... and that's it! You should now have a new version of the model and a deprecated version. The next section is meant for consumers to evaluate and migrate to the new version.
## Best practices for consumers[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#best-practices-for-consumers "Direct link to Best practices for consumers")
Consumers rely on upstream models and need to make sure that version transitions don’t introduce unintended breakages. Refer to the following steps to migrate to the new version:
  1. Begin writing a cross-project reference to use a public model from a different project. In this case, `{{ ref('upstream_project', 'fishtown_analytics_orders') }}`.
  2. Once you see deprecation warnings, test the latest version of a model by explicitly referencing it in your `ref`. For example, `{{ ref('upstream_project', 'fishtown_analytics_orders', v=2) }}`. Check if it's a breaking change for you or has any unintended impacts on your project.
     * If it does, consider explicitly “pinning” to the current, working version of the model before the new version becomes the default: `{{ ref('upstream_project', 'fishtown_analytics_orders', v=1) }}`. Bear in mind that you will need to migrate at some point before the deprecation date.
  3. Before the deprecation date, you can migrate to the new version of the model by removing the version specification in your cross-project reference: `{{ ref('upstream_project', 'fishtown_analytics_orders')`. Make any downstream logic changes needed to accommodate this new version.


Consumers should plan migrations to align with their own team’s release cycles.

## Why does structure matter?[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview?version=1.12#why-does-structure-matter "Direct link to Why does structure matter?")
Analytics engineering, at its core, is about helping groups of human beings collaborate on better decisions at scale. We have [limited bandwidth for making decisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue). We also, as a cooperative social species, rely on [systems and patterns to optimize collaboration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language) with others. This combination of traits means that for collaborative projects it's crucial to establish consistent and comprehensible norms such that your team’s limited bandwidth for decision making can be spent on unique and difficult problems, not deciding where folders should go or how to name files.
Building a great dbt project is an inherently collaborative endeavor, bringing together domain knowledge from every department to map the goals and narratives of the entire company. As such, it's especially important to establish a deep and broad set of patterns to ensure as many people as possible are empowered to leverage their particular expertise in a positive way, and to ensure that the project remains approachable and maintainable as your organization scales.
Famously, Steve Jobs [wore the same outfit everyday](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5453c539e4b02ab5398ffc8f/1580381503218-E56FQDNFL1P4OBLQWHWW/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kJKedFpub2aPqa33K4gNUDwUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYxCRW4BPu10St3TBAUQYVKcxb5ZTIyC_D49_DDQq2Sj8YVGtM7O1i4h5tvKa2lazN4nGUQWMS_WcPM-ztWbVr-c/steve_jobs_outfit.jpg) to reduce decision fatigue. You can think of this guide similarly, as a black turtleneck and New Balance sneakers for your company’s dbt project. A dbt project’s power outfit, or more accurately its structure, is composed not of fabric but of files, folders, naming conventions, and programming patterns. How you label things, group them, split them up, or bring them together — the system you use to organize the [data transformations](https://www.getdbt.com/analytics-engineering/transformation/) encoded in your dbt project — this is your project’s structure.
This guide is just a starting point. You may decide that you prefer Birkenstocks or a purple hoodie for your project over Jobs-ian minimalism. That's fine. What's important is that you think through the reasoning for those changes in your organization, explicitly declare them in a thorough, accessible way for all contributors, and above all _stay consistent_.
One foundational principle that applies to all dbt projects though, is the need to establish a cohesive arc moving data from _source-conformed_ to _business-conformed_. Source-conformed data is shaped by external systems out of our control, while business-conformed data is shaped by the needs, concepts, and definitions we create. No matter what patterns or conventions you define within your project, this process remains the essential purpose of the transformation layer, and dbt as your tool within it. This guide is an update to a seminal analytics engineering [post of the same name](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/how-we-structure-our-dbt-projects/355) by the great Claire Carroll, and while some of the details have changed over time (as anticipated in that post) this fundamental trajectory holds true. Moving forward, this guide will be iteratively updated as new tools expand our viewpoints, new experiences sharpen our vision, and new voices strengthen our perspectives, but always in service of that aim.
### Learning goals[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview?version=1.12#learning-goals "Direct link to Learning goals")
This guide has three main goals:
  * Thoroughly cover our most up-to-date recommendations on how to structure typical dbt projects
  * Illustrate these recommendations with comprehensive examples
  * At each stage, explain _why_ we recommend the approach that we do, so that you're equipped to decide when and where to deviate from these recommendations to better fit your organization’s unique needs


You should walk away from this guide with a deeper mental model of how the components of a dbt project fit together, such that purpose and principles of analytics engineering feel more clear and intuitive.
By approaching our structure intentionally, we’ll gain a better understanding of foundational ideals like moving our data from the wide array of narrower source-conformed models that our systems give us to a narrower set of wider, richer business-conformed designs we create. As we move along that arc, we’ll understand how stacking our transformations in optimized, modular layers means we can apply each transformation in only one place. With a disciplined approach to the files, folders, and materializations that comprise our structure, we’ll find that we can create clear stories not only through our data, but also our codebase and the artifacts it generates in our warehouse.
Our hope is that by deepening your sense of the connections between these patterns and the principles they flow from, you'll be able to translate them to fit your specific needs and craft customized documentation for your team to act on.
This guide walks through our recommendations using a very simple dbt project — similar to the one used for the Getting Started guide and many other demos — from a fictional company called the Jaffle Shop. You can read more about [jaffles](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/jaffle) if you want (they _are_ a real thing), but that context isn’t important to understand the structure. We encourage you to follow along, try things out, make changes, and take notes on what works or doesn't work for you along the way.
We'll get a deeper sense of our project as we move through the guide, but for now we just need to know that the Jaffle Shop is a restaurant selling jaffles that has two main data sources:
  * A replica of our transactional database, called `jaffle_shop`, with core entities like orders and customers.
  * Synced data from [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), which we use for processing payments.


### Guide structure overview[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview?version=1.12#guide-structure-overview "Direct link to Guide structure overview")
We'll walk through our topics in the same order that our data would move through transformation:
  1. Dig into how we structure the files, folders, and models for our three primary layers in the `models` directory, which build on each other:
    1. **Staging** — creating our atoms, our initial modular building blocks, from source data
    2. **Intermediate** — stacking layers of logic with clear and specific purposes to prepare our staging models to join into the entities we want
    3. **Marts** — bringing together our modular pieces into a wide, rich vision of the entities our organization cares about
  2. Explore how these layers fit into the rest of the project:
    1. Review the overall structure comprehensively
    2. Expand on YAML configuration in-depth
    3. Discuss how to use the other folders in a dbt project: `tests`, `seeds`, and `analyses`


Below is the complete file tree of the project we’ll be working through. Don’t worry if this looks like a lot of information to take in at once - this is just to give you the full vision of what we’re building towards. We’ll focus in on each of the sections one by one as we break down the project’s structure.

On this page
This page uses Snowflake for code examples, but you can adapt the lambda view pattern to other warehouses.
A lambda view pattern combines a batch / incremental fact table with a small near real-time (NRT) slice of very recent data and exposes them through a single view. This is a legacy-but-still-useful pattern some teams have used to deliver near real‑time operational dashboards on top of dbt and a warehouse.
## When to use lambda views[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/4-lambda-views?version=1.12#when-to-use-lambda-views "Direct link to When to use lambda views")
  * You need fresher reads than your normal incremental schedule, but
  * You can't (or don't want to) use [dynamic tables](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/snowflake-configs#dynamic-tables) or [materialized views](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/materializations#materialized-view), or you want to keep logic entirely in dbt SQL. The examples used in this page assume the following setup:


### Assumptions[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/4-lambda-views?version=1.12#assumptions "Direct link to Assumptions")
The examples used in this page assume the following setup:
  * Raw events land continuously into `raw.events` using your warehouse's streaming ingestion feature (like Snowpipe, Databricks Auto Loader, Kafka, or a similar ingestion mechanism).
  * You already maintain an [incremental fact table](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns#incremental-merge-from-append-only-tables) that is rebuilt every few minutes using `incremental_strategy='merge'`.
  * Most dashboards are fine reading from that incremental table, but a small set of operational dashboards want "as‑of‑now" data (for example, the last few minutes of events).


### How this pattern works[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/4-lambda-views?version=1.12#how-this-pattern-works "Direct link to How this pattern works")
  * The base incremental table is rebuilt every few minutes using `incremental_strategy='merge'`.
  * The NRT view is a view that selects only events newer than the max `event_ts` already persisted in the base incremental table.
  * The lambda view `UNION ALL`s the base table and the NRT view, de-duplicating rows based on primary key semantics.


Downstream BI or dashboards query only the lambda view.
## Base incremental table[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/4-lambda-views?version=1.12#base-incremental-table "Direct link to Base incremental table")
You can reuse the incremental `merge` from [Snowflake pattern 1](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns#incremental-merge-from-append-only-tables) as your base table; for completeness:
```
-- models/fct_events.sql{{ config(    materialized ='incremental',    incremental_strategy ='merge',    unique_key ='event_id',    cluster_by =['event_date'],    snowflake_warehouse ='TRANSFORM_WH'with source_events as(select        event_id,        event_ts::timestamp_ntz       as event_ts,        to_date(event_ts)as event_date,        user_id,        event_type,        payloadfrom {{ source('raw','events') }}%if is_incremental()%}-- Only pull new/changed rows since last successful loadwhere event_ts (selectmax(event_ts)from {{ this }})% endif %}select*from source_events;
```

Schedule this model to run, for example, every 5–15 minutes as part of your near real‑time job.
## NRT view: rows more recent than the base table[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/4-lambda-views?version=1.12#nrt-view-rows-more-recent-than-the-base-table "Direct link to NRT view: rows more recent than the base table")
The NRT view returns only events with `event_ts` greater than the maximum timestamp in the base table, so there is no overlap or double counting:
```
-- models/fct_events_nrt.sql{{ config(    materialized ='view'with base_max as(selectmax(event_ts)as max_event_tsfrom {{ ref('fct_events') }}fresh_events as(select.event_id,.event_ts::timestamp_ntz   as event_ts,        to_date(e.event_ts)as event_date,.user_id,.event_type,.payloadfrom {{ source('raw','events') }} as ecrossjoin base_maxwhere e.event_ts  base_max.max_event_tsselect*from fresh_events;
```

Characteristics:
  * No scheduling required — it's just a view over `raw.events` filtered by `max(event_ts)` from `fct_events`.
  * Every query against `fct_events_nrt` scans only "since last batch" data, which should be a small time window (for example, a few minutes or hours, depending on your job cadence).


### Lambda view: single read path for BI[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/4-lambda-views?version=1.12#lambda-view-single-read-path-for-bi "Direct link to Lambda view: single read path for BI")
The lambda view combines historical data from the base incremental table with the most recent events from the NRT view.
```
-- models/fct_events_lambda.sql{{ config(    materialized ='view'select    event_id,    event_ts,    event_date,    user_id,    event_type,    payloadfrom {{ ref('fct_events') }}unionallselect    event_id,    event_ts,    event_date,    user_id,    event_type,    payloadfrom {{ ref('fct_events_nrt') }};
```

Point your BI tools and dashboards to `analytics.fct_events_lambda`. Most data comes from the pre-computed incremental table, while the most recent events (since the last dbt run) come from a live query against `raw.events`.
This approach is outlined in [this original dbt lambda view blog post](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/how-to-create-near-real-time-models-with-just-dbt-sql/1457) which describes how teams like JetBlue wired near real‑time operational dashboards on Snowflake and dbt.
## Considerations[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/4-lambda-views?version=1.12#considerations "Direct link to Considerations")
Take the following into consideration when using this pattern:
  * **Cost profile**
    * Every query against `fct_events_lambda` must read the NRT slice from `raw.events` in addition to the base table.
    * Use this pattern only for truly operational dashboards that justify the extra per‑query cost.
  * **Freshness**
    * Freshness is bounded by:
      * Your dbt incremental job frequency (age of `fct_events`), plus
      * Ingestion latency into `raw.events` (Snowpipe / streaming layer).
  * **Complexity vs alternatives**
    * For many modern Snowflake implementations, a [dynamic table](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/snowflake-configs#dynamic-tables) or [materialized view](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/materializations#materialized-view) with a small `target_lag` can provide similar "always within X minutes" service level agreements with less custom SQL and warehouse‑managed incremental logic.
    * Lambda views are best positioned as an _advanced / legacy pattern_ you can still use for when you:
      * Want all logic in dbt SQL
      * Lack the right warehouse feature in your environment
      * Are extending an existing implementation already built this way

Once we’ve got our atoms ready to work with, we’ll set about bringing them together into more intricate, connected molecular shapes. The intermediate layer is where these molecules live, creating varied forms with specific purposes on the way towards the more complex proteins and cells we’ll use to breathe life into our data products.
### Intermediate: Files and folders[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/3-intermediate?version=1.12#intermediate-files-and-folders "Direct link to Intermediate: Files and folders")
Let’s take a look at the intermediate layer of our project to understand the purpose of this stage more concretely.
```
models/intermediate└── finance    ├── _int_finance__models.yml    └── int_payments_pivoted_to_orders.sql
```

  * **Folders**
    * ✅ **Subdirectories based on business groupings.** Much like the staging layer, we’ll house this layer of models inside their own `intermediate` subfolder. Unlike the staging layer, here we shift towards being business-conformed, splitting our models up into subdirectories not by their source system, but by their area of business concern.
  * **File names**
    * `✅ int_[entity]s_[verb]s.sql` - the variety of transformations that can happen inside of the intermediate layer makes it harder to dictate strictly how to name them. The best guiding principle is to think about _verbs_ (e.g. `pivoted`, `aggregated_to_user`, `joined`, `fanned_out_by_quantity`, `funnel_created`, etc.) in the intermediate layer. In our example project, we use an intermediate model to pivot payments out to the order grain, so we name our model `int_payments_pivoted_to_orders`. It’s easy for anybody to quickly understand what’s happening in that model, even if they don’t know [SQL](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/). That clarity is worth the long file name. It’s important to note that we’ve dropped the double underscores at this layer. In moving towards business-conformed concepts, we no longer need to separate a system and an entity and simply reference the unified entity if possible. In cases where you need intermediate models to operate at the source system level (e.g. `int_shopify__orders_summed`, `int_core__orders_summed` which you would later union), you’d preserve the double underscores. Some people like to separate the entity and verbs with double underscores as well. That’s a matter of preference, but in our experience, there is often an intrinsic connection between entities and verbs in this layer that make that difficult to maintain.


The example project is very simple for illustrative purposes. This level of division in our post-staging layers is probably unnecessary when dealing with these few models. Remember, our goal is a _single_ _source of truth._ We don’t want finance and marketing operating on separate `orders` models, we want to use our dbt project as a means to bring those definitions together! As such, don’t split and optimize too early. If you have less than 10 marts models and aren’t having problems developing and using them, feel free to forego subdirectories completely (except in the staging layer, where you should always implement them as you add new source systems to your project) until the project has grown to really need them. Using dbt is always about bringing simplicity to complexity.
### Intermediate: Models[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/3-intermediate?version=1.12#intermediate-models "Direct link to Intermediate: Models")
Below is the lone intermediate model from our small example project. This represents an excellent use case per our principles above, serving a clear single purpose: grouping and pivoting a staging model to different grain. It utilizes a bit of Jinja to make the model DRY-er (striving to be DRY applies to the code we write inside a single model in addition to transformations across the codebase), but don’t be intimidated if you’re not quite comfortable with [Jinja](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/jinja-macros) yet. Looking at the name of the CTE`pivot_and_aggregate_payments_to_order_grain` we get a very clear idea of what’s happening inside this block. By descriptively labeling the transformations happening inside our CTEs within our model, just as we do with our files and folders, even a stakeholder who doesn’t know SQL would be able to grasp the purpose of this section, if not the code. As you begin to write more complex transformations moving out of the staging layer, keep this idea in mind. In the same way our models connect into a DAG and tell the story of our transformations on a macro scale, CTEs can do this on a smaller scale inside our model files.
```
-- int_payments_pivoted_to_orders.sql{%-set payment_methods =['bank_transfer','credit_card','coupon','gift_card']-%}payments as(select*from {{ ref('stg_stripe__payments') }}pivot_and_aggregate_payments_to_order_grain as(select      order_id,%for payment_method in payment_methods -%}when payment_method ='{{ payment_method }}'andstatus='success'then amount)as {{ payment_method }}_amount,%- endfor %}sum(casewhenstatus='success'then amount end)as total_amountfrom paymentsgroupby1select*from pivot_and_aggregate_payments_to_order_grain
```

  * ❌ **Exposed to end users.** Intermediate models should generally not be exposed in the main production schema. They are not intended for output to final targets like dashboards or applications, so it’s best to keep them separated from models that are so you can more easily control data governance and discoverability.
  * ✅ **Materialized ephemerally.** Considering the above, one popular option is to default to intermediate models being materialized [ephemerally](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/materializations#ephemeral). This is generally the best place to start for simplicity. It will keep unnecessary models out of your warehouse with minimum configuration. Keep in mind though that the simplicity of ephemerals does translate a bit more difficulty in troubleshooting, as they’re interpolated into the models that `ref` them, rather than existing on their own in a way that you can view the output of.
  * ✅ **Materialized as views in a custom schema with special permissions.** A more robust option is to materialize your intermediate models as views in a specific [custom schema](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/custom-schemas), outside of your main production schema. This gives you added insight into development and easier troubleshooting as the number and complexity of your models grows, while remaining easy to implement and taking up negligible space.


There are three interfaces to the organizational knowledge graph we’re encoding into dbt and folder structure of our codebase, and the output into the warehouse. As such, it’s really important that we consider that output intentionally! Think of the schemas, tables, and views we’re creating in the warehouse as _part of the UX,_ in addition to the dashboards, ML, apps, and other use cases you may be targeting for the data. Ensuring that our output is named and grouped well, and that models not intended for broad use are either not materialized or built into special areas with specific permissions is crucial to achieving this.
  * Intermediate models’ purposes, as these serve to break up complexity from our marts models, can take as many forms as [data transformation](https://www.getdbt.com/analytics-engineering/transformation/) might require. Some of the most common use cases of intermediate models include:
    * ✅ **Structural simplification.** Bringing together a reasonable number (typically 4 to 6) of entities or concepts (staging models, or perhaps other intermediate models) that will be joined with another similarly purposed intermediate model to generate a mart — rather than have 10 joins in our mart, we can join two intermediate models that each house a piece of the complexity, giving us increased readability, flexibility, testing surface area, and insight into our components.
    * ✅ **Re-graining.** Intermediate models are often used to fan out or collapse models to the right composite grain — if we’re building a mart for `order_items` that requires us to fan out our `orders` based on the `quantity` column, creating a new single row for each item, this would be ideal to do in a specific intermediate model to maintain clarity in our mart and more easily view that our grain is correct before we mix it with other components.
    * ✅ **Isolating complex operations.** It’s helpful to move any particularly complex or difficult to understand pieces of logic into their own intermediate models. This not only makes them easier to refine and troubleshoot, but simplifies later models that can reference this concept in a more clearly readable way. For example, in the `quantity` fan out example above, we benefit by isolating this complex piece of logic so we can quickly debug and thoroughly test that transformation, and downstream models can reference `order_items` in a way that’s intuitively easy to grasp.


Until we get to the marts layer and start building our various outputs, we ideally want our DAG to look like an arrowhead pointed right. As we move from source-conformed to business-conformed, we’re also moving from numerous, narrow, isolated concepts to fewer, wider, joined concepts. We’re bringing our components together into wider, richer concepts, and that creates this shape in our DAG. This way when we get to the marts layer we have a robust set of components that can quickly and easily be put into any configuration to answer a variety of questions and serve specific needs. One rule of thumb to ensure you’re following this pattern on an individual model level is allowing multiple _inputs_ to a model, but **not** multiple _outputs_. Several arrows going _into_ our post-staging models is great and expected, several arrows coming _out_ is a red flag. There are absolutely situations where you need to break this rule, but it’s something to be aware of, careful about, and avoid when possible.

The staging layer is where our journey begins. This is the foundation of our project, where we bring all the individual components we're going to use to build our more complex and useful models into the project.
We'll use an analogy for working with dbt throughout this guide: thinking modularly in terms of atoms, molecules, and more complex outputs like proteins or cells (we apologize in advance to any chemists or biologists for our inevitable overstretching of this metaphor). Within that framework, if our source system data is a soup of raw energy and quarks, then you can think of the staging layer as condensing and refining this material into the individual atoms we’ll later build more intricate and useful structures with.
### Staging: Files and folders[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/2-staging?version=1.12#staging-files-and-folders "Direct link to Staging: Files and folders")
Let's zoom into the staging directory from our `models` file tree [in the overview](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview) and walk through what's going on here.
```
models/staging├── jaffle_shop│   ├── _jaffle_shop__docs.md│   ├── _jaffle_shop__models.yml│   ├── _jaffle_shop__sources.yml│   ├── base│   │   ├── base_jaffle_shop__customers.sql│   │   └── base_jaffle_shop__deleted_customers.sql│   ├── stg_jaffle_shop__customers.sql│   └── stg_jaffle_shop__orders.sql└── stripe    ├── _stripe__models.yml    ├── _stripe__sources.yml    └── stg_stripe__payments.sql
```

  * **Folders.** Folder structure is extremely important in dbt. Not only do we need a consistent structure to find our way around the codebase, as with any software project, but our folder structure is also one of the key interfaces for understanding the knowledge graph encoded in our project (alongside the DAG and the data output into our warehouse). It should reflect how the data flows, step-by-step, from a wide variety of source-conformed models into fewer, richer business-conformed models. Moreover, we can use our folder structure as a means of selection in dbt [selector syntax](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/syntax). For example, with the above structure, if we got fresh Stripe data loaded and wanted to run all the models that build on our Stripe data, we can easily run `dbt build --select staging.stripe+` and we’re all set for building more up-to-date reports on payments.
    * ✅ **Subdirectories based on the source system**. Our internal transactional database is one system, the data we get from Stripe's API is another, and lastly the events from our Snowplow instrumentation. We've found this to be the best grouping for most companies, as source systems tend to share similar loading methods and properties between tables, and this allows us to operate on those similar sets easily.
    * ❌ **Subdirectories based on loader.** Some people attempt to group by how the data is loaded (Fivetran, Stitch, custom syncs), but this is too broad to be useful on a project of any real size.
    * ❌ **Subdirectories based on business grouping.** Another approach we recommend against is splitting up by business groupings in the staging layer, and creating subdirectories like 'marketing', 'finance', etc. A key goal of any great dbt project should be establishing a single source of truth. By breaking things up too early, we open ourselves up to creating overlap and conflicting definitions (think marketing and financing having different fundamental tables for orders). We want everybody to be building with the same set of atoms, so in our experience, starting our transformations with our staging structure reflecting the source system structures is the best level of grouping for this step.
  * **File names.** Creating a consistent pattern of file naming is [crucial in dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/on-the-importance-of-naming). File names must be unique and correspond to the name of the model when selected and created in the warehouse. We recommend putting as much clear information into the file name as possible, including a prefix for the layer the model exists in, important grouping information, and specific information about the entity or transformation in the model.
    * ✅ `stg_[source]__[entity]s.sql` - the double underscore between source system and entity helps visually distinguish the separate parts in the case of a source name having multiple words. For instance, `google_analytics__campaigns` is always understandable, whereas to somebody unfamiliar `google_analytics_campaigns` could be `analytics_campaigns` from the `google` source system as easily as `campaigns` from the `google_analytics` source system. Think of it like an [oxford comma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_i1xk07o4g), the extra clarity is very much worth the extra punctuation.
    * ❌ `stg_[entity].sql` - might be specific enough at first, but will break down in time. Adding the source system into the file name aids in discoverability, and allows understanding where a component model came from even if you aren't looking at the file tree.
    * ✅ **Plural.** SQL, and particularly SQL in dbt, should read as much like prose as we can achieve. We want to lean into the broad clarity and declarative nature of SQL when possible. As such, unless there’s a single order in your `orders` table, plural is the correct way to describe what is in a table with multiple rows.


### Staging: Models[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/2-staging?version=1.12#staging-models "Direct link to Staging: Models")
Now that we’ve got a feel for how the files and folders fit together, let’s look inside one of these files and dig into what makes for a well-structured staging model.
Below, is an example of a standard staging model (from our `stg_stripe__payments` model) that illustrates the common patterns within the staging layer. We’ve organized our model into two CTEs[source macro](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/sources#selecting-from-a-source) and the other applying our transformations.
While our later layers of transformation will vary greatly from model to model, every one of our staging models will follow this exact same pattern. As such, we need to make sure the pattern we’ve established is rock solid and consistent.
```
-- stg_stripe__payments.sqlsource as(select*from {{ source('stripe','payment') }}renamed as(select-- idsas payment_id,        orderid as order_id,-- strings        paymentmethod as payment_method,when payment_method in('stripe','paypal','credit_card','gift_card')then'credit'else'cash'endas payment_type,status,-- numerics        amount as amount_cents,        amount /100.0as amount,-- booleanswhenstatus='successful'thentrueelsefalseendas is_completed_payment,-- dates        date_trunc('day', created)as created_date,-- timestamps        created::timestamp_ltz as created_atfrom sourceselect*from renamed
```

  * Based on the above, the most standard types of staging model transformations are:
    * ✅ **Renaming**
    * ✅ **Type casting**
    * ✅ **Basic computations** (e.g. cents to dollars)
    * ✅ **Categorizing** (using conditional logic to group values into buckets or booleans, such as in the `case when` statements above)
    * ❌ **Joins** — the goal of staging models is to clean and prepare individual source-conformed concepts for downstream usage. We're creating the most useful version of a source system table, which we can use as a new modular component for our project. In our experience, joins are almost always a bad idea here — they create immediate duplicated computation and confusing relationships that ripple downstream — there are occasionally exceptions though (refer to [base models](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/2-staging?version=1.12#staging-other-considerations) for more info).
    * ❌ **Aggregations** — aggregations entail grouping, and we're not doing that at this stage. Remember - staging models are your place to create the building blocks you’ll use all throughout the rest of your project — if we start changing the grain of our tables by grouping in this layer, we’ll lose access to source data that we’ll likely need at some point. We just want to get our individual concepts cleaned and ready for use, and will handle aggregating values downstream.
  * ✅ **Materialized as views.** Looking at a partial view of our `dbt_project.yml` below, we can see that we’ve configured the entire staging directory to be materialized as views
    * Any downstream model (discussed more in [marts](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/4-marts)) referencing our staging models will always get the freshest data possible from all of the component views it’s pulling together and materializing
    * It avoids wasting space in the warehouse on models that are not intended to be queried by data consumers, and thus do not need to perform as quickly or efficiently
```
# dbt_project.ymlmodels:jaffle_shop:staging:+materialized: view
```

  * Staging models are the only place we'll use the [`source` macro](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/sources), and our staging models should have a 1-to-1 relationship to our source tables. That means for each source system table we’ll have a single staging model referencing it, acting as its entry point — _staging_ it — for use downstream.


Staging models help us keep our code DRY
This is a welcome change for many of us who have become used to applying the same sets of SQL transformations in many places out of necessity! For us, the earliest point for these 'always-want' transformations is the staging layer, the initial entry point in our transformation process. The DRY principle is ultimately the litmus test for whether transformations should happen in the staging layer. If we'll want them in every downstream model and they help us eliminate repeated code, they're probably okay.
### Staging: Other considerations[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/2-staging?version=1.12#staging-other-considerations "Direct link to Staging: Other considerations")
  * **Base models when joins are necessary to stage concepts.** Sometimes, in order to maintain a clean and DRY`base` models. These have all the same properties that would normally be in the staging layer, they will directly source the raw data and do the non-joining transformations, then in the staging models we’ll join the requisite base models. The most common use cases for building a base layer under a staging folder are:
    * ✅ **Joining in separate delete tables**. Sometimes a source system might store deletes in a separate table. Typically we’ll want to make sure we can mark or filter out deleted records for all our component models, so we’ll need to join these delete records up to any of our entities that follow this pattern. This is the example shown below to illustrate.
```
-- base_jaffle_shop__customers.sqlsource as(select*from {{ source('jaffle_shop','customers') }}customers as(selectas customer_id,        first_name,        last_namefrom sourceselect*from customers
```

```
-- base_jaffle_shop__deleted_customers.sqlsource as(select*from {{ source('jaffle_shop','customer_deletes') }}deleted_customers as(selectas customer_id,        deleted as deleted_atfrom sourceselect*from deleted_customers
```

```
-- stg_jaffle_shop__customers.sqlcustomers as(select*from {{ ref('base_jaffle_shop__customers') }}deleted_customers as(select*from {{ ref('base_jaffle_shop__deleted_customers') }}join_and_mark_deleted_customers as(select        customers.*,when deleted_customers.deleted_at isnotnullthentrueelsefalseendas is_deletedfrom customersleftjoin deleted_customers on customers.customer_id = deleted_customers.customer_idselect*from join_and_mark_deleted_customers
```

    * ✅ **Unioning disparate but symmetrical sources**. A typical example here would be if you operate multiple ecommerce platforms in various territories via a SaaS platform like Shopify. You would have perfectly identical schemas, but all loaded separately into your warehouse. In this case, it’s easier to reason about our orders if _all_ of our shops are unioned together, so we’d want to handle the unioning in a base model before we carry on with our usual staging model transformations on the (now complete) set — you can dig into [more detail on this use case here](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/unioning-identically-structured-data-sources/921).
  * **[Codegen](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-codegen) to automate staging table generation.** It’s very good practice to learn to write staging models by hand, they’re straightforward and numerous, so they can be an excellent way to absorb the dbt style of writing SQL. Also, we’ll invariably find ourselves needing to add special elements to specific models at times — for instance, in one of the situations above that require base models — so it’s helpful to deeply understand how they work. Once that understanding is established though, because staging models are built largely following the same rote patterns and need to be built 1-to-1 for each source table in a source system, it’s preferable to start automating their creation. For this, we have the [codegen](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-codegen) package. This will let you automatically generate all the source YAML and staging model boilerplate to speed up this step, and we recommend using it in every project.
  * **Utilities folder.** While this is not in the `staging` folder, it’s useful to consider as part of our fundamental building blocks. The `models/utilities` directory is where we can keep any general purpose models that we generate from macros or based on seeds that provide tools to help us do our modeling, rather than data to model itself. The most common use case is a [date spine](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils#date_spine-source) generated with [the dbt utils package](https://hub.getdbt.com/dbt-labs/dbt_utils/latest/).


This guide follows the order of the DAG, so we can get a holistic picture of how these three primary layers build on each other towards fueling impactful data products. It’s important to note though that developing models does not typically move linearly through the DAG. Most commonly, we should start by mocking out a design in a spreadsheet so we know we’re aligned with our stakeholders on output goals. Then, we’ll want to write the SQL to generate that output, and identify what tables are involved. Once we have our logic and dependencies, we’ll make sure we’ve staged all the necessary atomic pieces into the project, then bring them together based on the logic we wrote to generate our mart. Finally, with a functioning model flowing in dbt, we can start refactoring and optimizing that mart. By splitting the logic up and moving parts back upstream into intermediate models, we ensure all of our models are clean and readable, the story of our DAG is clear, and we have more surface area to apply thorough testing.

Our guidance here diverges if you use the Semantic Layer. In a project without the Semantic Layer we recommend you denormalize heavily, per the best practices below. On the other hand, if you're using the Semantic Layer, we want to stay as normalized as possible to allow MetricFlow the most flexibility. See [The dbt Semantic Layer and marts](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/4-marts?version=1.12#the-dbt-semantic-layer-and-marts) for more information.
This is the layer where everything comes together and we start to arrange all of our atoms (staging models) and molecules (intermediate models) into full-fledged cells that have identity and purpose. We sometimes like to call this the _entity_ _layer_ or _concept layer_ , to emphasize that all our marts are meant to represent a specific entity or concept at its unique grain. For instance, an order, a customer, a territory, a click event, a payment — each of these would be represented with a distinct mart, and each row would represent a discrete instance of these concepts. Unlike in a traditional Kimball star schema though, in modern data warehousing — where storage is cheap and compute is expensive — we’ll happily borrow and add any and all data from other concepts that are relevant to answering questions about the mart’s core entity. Building the same data in multiple places, as we do with `orders` in our `customers` mart example below, is more efficient in this paradigm than repeatedly rejoining these concepts (this is a basic definition of denormalization in this context). Let’s take a look at how we approach this first layer intended expressly for exposure to end users.
### Marts: Files and folders[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/4-marts?version=1.12#marts-files-and-folders "Direct link to Marts: Files and folders")
The last layer of our core transformations is below, providing models for both `finance` and `marketing` departments.
```
models/marts├── finance│   ├── _finance__models.yml│   ├── orders.sql│   └── payments.sql└── marketing    ├── _marketing__models.yml    └── customers.sql
```

✅ **Group by department or area of concern.** If you have fewer than 10 or so marts you may not have much need for subfolders, so as with the intermediate layer, don’t over-optimize too early. If you do find yourself needing to insert more structure and grouping though, use useful business concepts here. In our marts layer, we’re no longer worried about source-conformed data, so grouping by departments (marketing, finance, etc.) is the most common structure at this stage.
✅ **Name by entity.** Use plain English to name the file based on the concept that forms the grain of the mart’s `customers`, `orders`. Marts that don't include any time-based rollups (pure marts) should not have a time dimension (`orders_per_day`) here, typically best captured via metrics.
❌ **Build the same concept differently for different teams.** `finance_orders` and `marketing_orders` is typically considered an anti-pattern. There are, as always, exceptions — a common pattern we see is that, finance may have specific needs, for example reporting revenue to the government in a way that diverges from how the company as a whole measures revenue day-to-day. Just make sure that these are clearly designed and understandable as _separate_ concepts, not departmental views on the same concept: `tax_revenue` and `revenue` not `finance_revenue` and `marketing_revenue`.
### Marts: Models[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/4-marts?version=1.12#marts-models "Direct link to Marts: Models")
Finally we’ll take a look at the best practices for models within the marts directory by examining two of our marts models. These are the business-conformed — that is, crafted to our vision and needs — entities we’ve been bringing these transformed components together to create.
```
-- orders.sqlorders as(select*from {{ ref('stg_jaffle_shop__orders')}}order_payments as(select*from {{ ref('int_payments_pivoted_to_orders') }}orders_and_order_payments_joined as(select        orders.order_id,        orders.customer_id,        orders.order_date,coalesce(order_payments.total_amount,0)as amount,coalesce(order_payments.gift_card_amount,0)as gift_card_amountfrom ordersleftjoin order_payments on orders.order_id = order_payments.order_idselect*from orders_and_order_payments_joined
```

```
-- customers.sqlcustomers as(select*from {{ ref('stg_jaffle_shop__customers')}}orders as(select*from {{ ref('orders')}}customer_orders as(select        customer_id,min(order_date)as first_order_date,max(order_date)as most_recent_order_date,count(order_id)as number_of_orders,sum(amount)as lifetime_valuefrom ordersgroupby1customers_and_customer_orders_joined as(select        customers.customer_id,        customers.first_name,        customers.last_name,        customer_orders.first_order_date,        customer_orders.most_recent_order_date,coalesce(customer_orders.number_of_orders,0)as number_of_orders,        customer_orders.lifetime_valuefrom customersleftjoin customer_orders on customers.customer_id = customer_orders.customer_idselect*from customers_and_customer_orders_joined
```

  * ✅ **Materialized as tables or incremental models.** Once we reach the marts layer, it’s time to start building not just our logic into the warehouse, but the data itself. This gives end users much faster performance for these later models that are actually designed for their use, and saves us costs recomputing these entire chains of models every time somebody refreshes a dashboard or runs a regression in python. A good general rule of thumb regarding materialization is to always start with a view (as it takes up essentially no storage and always gives you up-to-date results), once that view takes too long to practically _query_ , build it into a table, and finally once that table takes too long to _build_ and is slowing down your runs, [configure it as an incremental model](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-models). As always, start simple and only add complexity as necessary. The models with the most data and compute-intensive transformations should absolutely take advantage of dbt’s excellent incremental materialization options, but rushing to make all your marts models incremental by default will introduce superfluous difficulty. We recommend reading this [classic post from Tristan on the limits of incremental modeling](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/on-the-limits-of-incrementality/303).
  * ✅ **Wide and denormalized.** Unlike old school warehousing, in the modern data stack storage is cheap and it’s compute that is expensive and must be prioritized as such, packing these into very wide denormalized concepts that can provide everything somebody needs about a concept as a goal.
  * ❌ **Too many joins in one mart.** One good rule of thumb when building dbt transformations is to avoid bringing together too many concepts in a single mart. What constitutes ‘too many’ can vary. If you need to bring 8 staging models together with nothing but simple joins, that might be fine. Conversely, if you have 4 concepts you’re weaving together with some complex and computationally heavy window functions, that could be too much. You need to weigh the number of models you’re joining against the complexity of the logic within the mart, and if it’s too much to read through and build a clear mental model of then look to modularize. While this isn’t a hard rule, if you’re bringing together more than 4 or 5 concepts to create your mart, you may benefit from adding some intermediate models for added clarity. Two intermediate models that bring together three concepts each, and a mart that brings together those two intermediate models, will typically result in a much more readable chain of logic than a single mart with six joins.
  * ✅ **Build on separate marts thoughtfully.** While we strive to preserve a narrowing DAG up to the marts layer, once here things may start to get a little less strict. A common example is passing information between marts at different grains, as we saw above, where we bring our `orders` mart into our `customers` marts to aggregate critical order data into a `customer` grain. Now that we’re really ‘spending’ compute and storage by actually building the data in our outputs, it’s sensible to leverage previously built resources to speed up and save costs on outputs that require similar data, versus recomputing the same views and CTEs from scratch. The right approach here is heavily dependent on your unique DAG, models, and goals — it’s just important to note that using a mart in building another, later mart is okay, but requires careful consideration to avoid wasted resources or circular dependencies.


The most important aspect of marts is that they contain all of the useful data about a _particular entity_ at a granular level. That doesn’t mean we don’t bring in lots of other entities and concepts, like tons of `user` data into our `orders` mart, we do! It just means that individual `orders` remain the core grain of our table. If we start grouping `users` and `orders` along a [date spine](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils#date_spine-source), into something like `user_orders_per_day`, we’re moving past marts into _metrics_.
### Marts: Other considerations[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/4-marts?version=1.12#marts-other-considerations "Direct link to Marts: Other considerations")
  * **Troubleshoot via tables.** While stacking views and ephemeral models up until our marts — only building data into the warehouse at the end of a chain when we have the models we really want end users to work with — is ideal in production, it can present some difficulties in development. Particularly, certain errors may seem to be surfacing in our later models that actually stem from much earlier dependencies in our model chain (ancestor models in our DAG that are built before the model throws the errors). If you’re having trouble pinning down where or what a database error is telling you, it can be helpful to temporarily build a specific chain of models as tables so that the warehouse will throw the error where it’s actually occurring.


### The dbt Semantic Layer and marts[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/4-marts?version=1.12#the-dbt-semantic-layer-and-marts "Direct link to The dbt Semantic Layer and marts")
Our structural recommendations are impacted quite a bit by whether or not you’re using the Semantic Layer. If you're using the Semantic Layer, we recommend a more normalized approach to your marts. If you're not using the Semantic Layer, we recommend a more denormalized approach that has become typical in dbt projects. For the full list of recommendations on structure, naming, and organization in the Semantic Layer, check out the [How we build our metrics](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-1-intro) guide, particularly the [Refactoring an existing rollup](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-8-refactor-a-rollup) section.

## Why does style matter?[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/0-how-we-style-our-dbt-projects?version=1.12#why-does-style-matter "Direct link to Why does style matter?")
Style might seem like a trivial, surface-level issue, but it's a deeply material aspect of a well-built project. A consistent, clear style enhances readability and makes your project easier to understand and maintain. Highly readable code helps build clear mental models making it easier to debug and extend your project. It's not just a favor to yourself, though; equally importantly, it makes it less effort for others to understand and contribute to your project, which is essential for peer collaboration, open-source work, and onboarding new team members. [A style guide lets you focus on what matters](https://mtlynch.io/human-code-reviews-1/#settle-style-arguments-with-a-style-guide), the logic and impact of your project, rather than the superficialities of how it's written. This brings harmony and pace to your team's work, and makes reviews more enjoyable and valuable.
## What's important about style?[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/0-how-we-style-our-dbt-projects?version=1.12#whats-important-about-style "Direct link to What's important about style?")
There are two crucial tenets of code style:
  * Clarity
  * Consistency


Style your code in such a way that you can quickly read and understand it. It's also important to consider code review and git diffs. If you're making a change to a model, you want reviewers to see just the material changes you're making clearly.
Once you've established a clear style, stay consistent. This is the most important thing. Everybody on your team needs to have a unified style, which is why having a style guide is so crucial. If you're writing a model, you should be able to look at other models in the project that your teammates have written and read in the same style. If you're writing a macro or a test, you should see the same style as your models. Consistency is key.
## How should I style?[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/0-how-we-style-our-dbt-projects?version=1.12#how-should-i-style "Direct link to How should I style?")
You should style the project in a way you and your teammates or collaborators agree on. The most important thing is that you have a style guide and stick to it. This guide is just a suggestion to get you started and to give you a sense of what a style guide might look like. It covers various areas you may want to consider, with suggested rules. It emphasizes lots of whitespace, clarity, clear naming, and comments.
We believe one of the strengths of SQL is that it reads like English, so we lean into that declarative nature throughout our projects. Even within dbt Labs, though, there are differing opinions on how to style, even a small but passionate contingent of leading comma enthusiasts! Again, the important thing is not to follow this style guide; it's to make _your_ style guide and follow it. Lastly, be sure to include rules, tools, _and_ examples in your style guide to make it as easy as possible for your team to follow.
## Automation[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/0-how-we-style-our-dbt-projects?version=1.12#automation "Direct link to Automation")
Use formatters and linters as much as possible. We're all human, we make mistakes. Not only that, but we all have different preferences and opinions while writing code. Automation is a great way to ensure that your project is styled consistently and correctly and that people can write in a way that's quick and comfortable for them, while still getting perfectly consistent output.

## Fields and model names[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/1-how-we-style-our-dbt-models#fields-and-model-names "Direct link to Fields and model names")
  * 👥 Models should be pluralized, for example, `customers`, `orders`, `products`.
  * 🔑 Each model should have a primary key.
  * 🔑 The primary key of a model should be named `<object>_id`, for example, `account_id`. This makes it easier to know what `id` is being referenced in downstream joined models.
  * Use underscores for naming dbt models; avoid dots.
    * ✅ `models_without_dots`
    * ❌ `models.with.dots`
    * Most data platforms use dots to separate `database.schema.object`, so using underscores instead of dots reduces your need for [quoting](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/quoting) as well as the risk of issues in certain parts of dbt. For more background, refer to [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/3246).
  * 🔑 Keys should be string data types.
  * 🔑 Consistency is key! Use the same field names across models where possible. For example, a key to the `customers` table should be named `customer_id` rather than `user_id` or 'id'.
  * ❌ Do not use abbreviations or aliases. Emphasize readability over brevity. For example, do not use `cust` for `customer` or `o` for `orders`.
  * ❌ Avoid reserved words as column names.
  * ➕ Booleans should be prefixed with `is_` or `has_`.
  * 🕰️ Timestamp columns should be named `<event>_at`(for example, `created_at`) and should be in UTC. If a different timezone is used, this should be indicated with a suffix (`created_at_pt`).
  * 📆 Dates should be named `<event>_date`. For example, `created_date.`
  * 🔙 Events dates and times should be past tense — `created`, `updated`, or `deleted`.
  * 💱 Price/revenue fields should be in decimal currency (`19.99` for $19.99; many app databases store prices as integers in cents). If a non-decimal currency is used, indicate this with a suffix (`price_in_cents`).
  * 🐍 Schema, table and column names should be in `snake_case`.
  * 🏦 Use names based on the _business_ terminology, rather than the source terminology. For example, if the source database uses `user_id` but the business calls them `customer_id`, use `customer_id` in the model.
  * 🔢 Versions of models should use the suffix `_v1`, `_v2`, etc for consistency (`customers_v1` and `customers_v2`).
  * 🗄️ Use a consistent ordering of data types and consider grouping and labeling columns by type, as in the example below. This will minimize join errors and make it easier to read the model, as well as help downstream consumers of the data understand the data types and scan models for the columns they need. We prefer to use the following order: ids, strings, numerics, booleans, dates, and timestamps.


## Example model[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/1-how-we-style-our-dbt-models#example-model "Direct link to Example model")

## Python tooling[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/3-how-we-style-our-python?version=1.12#python-tooling "Direct link to Python tooling")
  * 🐍 Python has a more mature and robust ecosystem for formatting and linting (helped by the fact that it doesn't have a million distinct dialects). We recommend using those tools to format and lint your code in the style you prefer.
  * 🛠️ Our current recommendations are
    * [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) formatter
    * [ruff](https://pypi.org/project/ruff/) linter
☁️ dbt comes with the [black formatter built-in](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/studio-ide/lint-format) to automatically lint and format their Python. You don't need to download or configure anything, just click `Format` in a Python model and you're good to go!

### Project structure review[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/5-the-rest-of-the-project?version=1.12#project-structure-review "Direct link to Project structure review")
So far we’ve focused on the `models` folder, the primary directory of our dbt project. Next, we’ll zoom out and look at how the rest of our project files and folders fit in with this structure, starting with how we approach YAML configuration files.
```
models├── intermediate│   └── finance│       ├── _int_finance__models.yml│       └── int_payments_pivoted_to_orders.sql├── marts│   ├── finance│   │   ├── _finance__models.yml│   │   ├── orders.sql│   │   └── payments.sql│   └── marketing│       ├── _marketing__models.yml│       └── customers.sql├── staging│   ├── jaffle_shop│   │   ├── _jaffle_shop__docs.md│   │   ├── _jaffle_shop__models.yml│   │   ├── _jaffle_shop__sources.yml│   │   ├── base│   │   │   ├── base_jaffle_shop__customers.sql│   │   │   └── base_jaffle_shop__deleted_customers.sql│   │   ├── stg_jaffle_shop__customers.sql│   │   └── stg_jaffle_shop__orders.sql│   └── stripe│       ├── _stripe__models.yml│       ├── _stripe__sources.yml│       └── stg_stripe__payments.sql└── utilities    └── all_dates.sql
```

### YAML in-depth[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/5-the-rest-of-the-project?version=1.12#yaml-in-depth "Direct link to YAML in-depth")
When structuring your YAML configuration files in a dbt project, you want to balance centralization and file size to make specific configs as easy to find as possible. It’s important to note that while the top-level YAML files (`dbt_project.yml`, `packages.yml`) need to be specifically named and in specific locations, the files containing your `sources` and `models` dictionaries can be named, located, and organized however you want. It’s the internal contents that matter here. As such, we’ll lay out our primary recommendation, as well as the pros and cons of a popular alternative. Like many other aspects of structuring your dbt project, what’s most important here is consistency, clear intention, and thorough documentation on how and why you do what you do.
  * ✅ **Config per folder.** As in the example above, create a `_[directory]__models.yml` per directory in your models folder that configures all the models in that directory. for staging folders, also include a `_[directory]__sources.yml` per directory.
    * The leading underscore ensures your YAML files will be sorted to the top of every folder to make them easy to separate from your models.
    * YAML files don’t need unique names in the way that SQL model files do, but including the directory (instead of simply `_sources.yml` in each folder), means you can fuzzy find the right file more quickly.
    * We’ve recommended several different naming conventions over the years, most recently calling these `schema.yml` files. We’ve simplified to recommend that these simply be labelled based on the YAML dictionary that they contain.
    * If you utilize [doc blocks](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/documentation#using-docs-blocks) in your project, we recommend following the same pattern, and creating a `_[directory]__docs.md` markdown file per directory containing all your doc blocks for that folder of models.
  * ❌ **Config per project.** Some people put _all_ of their source and model YAML into one file. While you can technically do this, and while it certainly simplifies knowing what file the config you’re looking for will be in (as there is only one file), it makes it much harder to find specific configurations within that file. We recommend balancing those two concerns.
  * ⚠️ **Config per model.** On the other end of the spectrum, some people prefer to create one YAML file per model. This presents less of an issue than a single monolith file, as you can quickly search for files, know exactly where specific configurations exist, spot models without configs (and thus without tests) by looking at the file tree, and various other advantages. In our opinion, the extra files, tabs, and windows this requires creating, copying from, pasting to, closing, opening, and managing creates a somewhat slower development experience that outweighs the benefits. Defining config per directory is the most balanced approach for most projects, but if you have compelling reasons to use config per model, there are definitely some great projects that follow this paradigm.
  * ✅ **Cascade configs.** Leverage your `dbt_project.yml` to set default configurations at the directory level. Use the well-organized folder structure we’ve created thus far to define the baseline schemas and materializations, and use dbt’s cascading scope priority to define variations to this. For example, as below, define your marts to be materialized as tables by default, define separate schemas for our separate subfolders, and any models that need to use incremental materialization can be defined at the model level.


```
-- dbt_project.ymlmodels:jaffle_shop:staging:+materialized: viewintermediate:+materialized: ephemeralmarts:+materialized: tablefinance:+schema: financemarketing:+schema: marketing
```

One of the many benefits this consistent approach to project structure confers to us is this ability to cascade default behavior. Carefully organizing our folders and defining configuration at that level whenever possible frees us from configuring things like schema and materialization in every single model (not very DRY!) — we only need to configure exceptions to our general rules. Tagging is another area this principle comes into play. Many people new to dbt will rely on tags rather than a rigorous folder structure, and quickly find themselves in a place where every model _requires_ a tag. This creates unnecessary complexity. We want to lean on our folders as our primary selectors and grouping mechanism, and use tags to define groups that are _exceptions._ A folder-based selection like **`dbt build --select marts.marketing` is much simpler than trying to tag every marketing-related model, hoping all developers remember to add that tag for new models, and using `dbt build --select tag:marketing`.
#### Defining groups[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/5-the-rest-of-the-project?version=1.12#defining-groups "Direct link to Defining groups")
A group is a collection of nodes within a dbt DAG. Groups enable intentional collaboration within and across teams by restricting [access to private](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/access) models.
Groups are defined in `.yml` files, nested under a `groups:` key. You can add the `meta` config to add more information about the group.
models/marts/finance/finance.yml
```
groups:-name: financeowner:# 'name' or 'email' is required; additional properties will no longer be allowed in a future releaseemail: finance@jaffleshop.comconfig:meta:# optionaldata_owner: Finance team
```

For more information about using groups, see [Add groups to your DAG](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/groups).
### How we use the other folders[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/5-the-rest-of-the-project?version=1.12#how-we-use-the-other-folders "Direct link to How we use the other folders")
```
jaffle_shop├── analyses├── seeds│   └── employees.csv├── macros│   ├── _macros.yml│   └── cents_to_dollars.sql├── snapshots└── tests└── assert_positive_value_for_total_amount.sql
```

We’ve focused heavily thus far on the primary area of action in our dbt project, the `models` folder. As you’ve probably observed though, there are several other folders in our project. While these are, by design, very flexible to your needs, we’ll discuss the most common use cases for these other folders to help get you started.
  * ✅ `seeds` for lookup tables. The most common use case for seeds is loading lookup tables that are helpful for modeling but don’t exist in any source systems — think mapping zip codes to states, or UTM parameters to marketing campaigns. In this example project we have a small seed that maps our employees to their `customer_id`s, so that we can handle their purchases with special logic.
  * ❌ `seeds` for loading source data. Do not use seeds to load data from a source system into your warehouse. If it exists in a system you have access to, you should be loading it with a proper EL tool into the raw data area of your warehouse. dbt is designed to operate on data in the warehouse, not as a data-loading tool.
  * ✅ `analyses` for storing auditing queries. The `analyses` folder lets you store any queries you want to use Jinja with and version control, but not build into models in your warehouse. There are limitless possibilities here, but the most common use case when we set up projects at dbt Labs is to keep queries that leverage the [audit helper](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-audit-helper) package. This package is incredibly useful for finding discrepancies in output when migrating logic from another system into dbt.
  * ✅ `tests` for testing multiple specific tables simultaneously. As dbt tests have evolved, writing singular tests has become less and less necessary. It's extremely useful for work-shopping test logic, but more often than not you'll find yourself either migrating that logic into your own custom generic tests or discovering a pre-built test that meets your needs from the ever-expanding universe of dbt packages (between the extra tests in [`dbt-utils`](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils) and [`dbt-expectations`](https://github.com/calogica/dbt-expectations) almost any situation is covered). One area where singular tests still shine though is flexibly testing things that require a variety of specific models. If you're familiar with the difference between [unit tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) [and](https://www.testim.io/blog/unit-test-vs-integration-test/) [integration](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/what-is-integration-testing/) [tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing) in software engineering, you can think of generic and singular tests in a similar way. If you need to test the results of how several specific models interact or relate to each other, a singular test will likely be the quickest way to nail down your logic.
  * ✅ `snapshots` for creating [Type 2 slowly changing dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowly_changing_dimension#Type_2:_add_new_row) records from [Type 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowly_changing_dimension#Type_1:_overwrite) (destructively updated) source data. This is [covered thoroughly in the dbt Docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/snapshots), unlike these other folders has a more defined purpose, and is out-of-scope for this guide, but mentioned for completion.
  * ✅ `macros` for DRY-ing up transformations you find yourself doing repeatedly. Like snapshots, a full dive into macros is out-of-scope for this guide and well [covered elsewhere](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/jinja-macros), but one important structure-related recommendation is to [write documentation for your macros](https://docs.getdbt.com/faqs/Docs/documenting-macros). We recommend creating a `_macros.yml` and documenting the purpose and arguments for your macros once they’re ready for use.


### Project splitting[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/5-the-rest-of-the-project?version=1.12#project-splitting "Direct link to Project splitting")
One important, growing consideration in the analytics engineering ecosystem is how and when to split a codebase into multiple dbt projects. Currently, our advice for most teams, especially those just starting, is fairly simple: in most cases, we recommend doing so with [Mesh](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-1-intro)! Mesh allows organizations to handle complexity by connecting several dbt projects rather than relying on one big, monolithic project. This approach is designed to speed up development while maintaining governance.
As breaking up monolithic dbt projects into smaller, connected projects, potentially within a modern mono repo becomes easier, the scenarios we currently advise against may soon become feasible. So watch this space!
  * ✅ **Business groups or departments.** Conceptual separations within the project are the primary reason to split up your project. This allows your business domains to own their own data products and still collaborate using Mesh. For more information about Mesh, please refer to our [Mesh FAQs](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-5-faqs).
  * ✅ **Data governance.** Structural, organizational needs — such as data governance and security — are one of the few worthwhile reasons to split up a project. If, for instance, you work at a healthcare company with only a small team cleared to access raw data with PII in it, you may need to split out your staging models into their own projects to preserve those policies. In that case, you would import your staging project into the project that builds on those staging models as a [private package](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/packages#private-packages).
  * ✅ **Project size.** At a certain point, your project may grow to have simply too many models to present a viable development experience. If you have 1000s of models, it absolutely makes sense to find a way to split up your project.
  * ❌ **ML vs Reporting use cases.** Similarly to the point above, splitting a project up based on different use cases, particularly more standard BI versus ML features, is a common idea. We tend to discourage it for the time being. As with the previous point, a foundational goal of implementing dbt is to create a single source of truth in your organization. The features you’re providing to your data science teams should be coming from the same marts and metrics that serve reports on executive dashboards.


## Final considerations[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/5-the-rest-of-the-project?version=1.12#final-considerations "Direct link to Final considerations")
Overall, consistency is more important than any of these specific conventions. As your project grows and your experience with dbt deepens, you will undoubtedly find aspects of the above structure you want to change. While we recommend this approach for the majority of projects, every organization is unique! The only dogmatic advice we’ll put forward here is that when you find aspects of the above structure you wish to change, think intently about your reasoning and document for your team _how_ and _why_ you are deviating from these conventions. To that end, we highly encourage you to fork this guide and add it to your project’s README, wiki, or docs so you can quickly create and customize those artifacts.
Finally, we emphasize that this guide is a living document! It will certainly change and grow as dbt and dbt Labs evolve. We invite you to join in — discuss, comment, and contribute regarding suggested changes or new elements to cover.

## Jinja style guide[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/4-how-we-style-our-jinja#jinja-style-guide "Direct link to Jinja style guide")
  * 🫧 When using Jinja delimiters, use spaces on the inside of your delimiter, like `{{ this }}` instead of `{{this}}`
  * 🆕 Use newlines to visually indicate logical blocks of Jinja.
  * 4️⃣ Indent 4 spaces into a Jinja block to indicate visually that the code inside is wrapped by that block.
  * ❌ Don't worry (too much) about Jinja whitespace control, focus on your project code being readable. The time you save by not worrying about whitespace control will far outweigh the time you spend in your compiled code where it might not be perfect.

On this page
## Basics[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/2-how-we-style-our-sql?version=1.12#basics "Direct link to Basics")
  * ☁️ Use [SQLFluff](https://sqlfluff.com/) to maintain these style rules automatically.
    * Customize `.sqlfluff` configuration files to your needs.
    * Refer to our [SQLFluff config file](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle-shop-template/blob/main/.sqlfluff) for the rules we use in our own projects.
    * Exclude files and directories by using a standard `.sqlfluffignore` file. Learn more about the syntax in the [.sqlfluffignore syntax docs](https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/configuration/index.html).
      * Excluding unnecessary folders and files (such as `target/`, `dbt_packages/`, and `macros/`) can speed up linting, improve run times, and help you avoid irrelevant logs.
  * 👻 Use Jinja comments (`{# #}`) for comments that should not be included in the compiled SQL.
  * ⏭️ Use trailing commas.
  * 4️⃣ Indents should be four spaces.
  * 📏 Lines of SQL should be no longer than 80 characters.
  * ⬇️ Field names, keywords, and function names should all be lowercase.
  * 🫧 The `as` keyword should be used explicitly when aliasing a field or table.


☁️ dbt users can use the built-in [SQLFluff Studio IDE integration](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/studio-ide/lint-format) to automatically lint and format their SQL. The default style sheet is based on dbt Labs style as outlined in this guide, but you can customize this to fit your needs. No need to setup any external tools, just hit `Lint`! Also, the more opinionated [sqlfmt](http://sqlfmt.com/) formatter is also available if you prefer that style.
## Fields, aggregations, and grouping[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/2-how-we-style-our-sql?version=1.12#fields-aggregations-and-grouping "Direct link to Fields, aggregations, and grouping")
  * 🔙 Fields should be stated before aggregates and window functions.
  * 🤏🏻 Aggregations should be executed as early as possible (on the smallest data set possible) before joining to another table to improve performance.
  * 🔢 Ordering and grouping by a number (eg. group by 1, 2) is preferred over listing the column names (see [this classic rant](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/write-better-sql-a-defense-of-group-by-1) for why). Note that if you are grouping by more than a few columns, it may be worth revisiting your model design.


## Joins[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/2-how-we-style-our-sql?version=1.12#joins "Direct link to Joins")
  * 👭🏻 Prefer `union all` to `union` unless you explicitly want to remove duplicates.
  * 👭🏻 If joining two or more tables, _always_ prefix your column names with the table name. If only selecting from one table, prefixes are not needed.
  * 👭🏻 Be explicit about your join type (i.e. write `inner join` instead of `join`).
  * 🥸 Avoid table aliases in join conditions (especially initialisms) — it's harder to understand what the table called "c" is as compared to "customers".
  * ➡️ Always move left to right to make joins easy to reason about - `right joins` often indicate that you should change which table you select `from` and which one you `join` to.


## 'Import' CTEs[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/2-how-we-style-our-sql?version=1.12#import-ctes "Direct link to 'Import' CTEs")
  * 🔝 All `{{ ref('...') }}` statements should be placed in CTEs at the top of the file.
  * 📦 'Import' CTEs should be named after the table they are referencing.
  * 🤏🏻 Limit the data scanned by CTEs as much as possible. Where possible, only select the columns you're actually using and use `where` clauses to filter out unneeded data.
  * For example:


```
orders as(select        order_id,        customer_id,        order_total,        order_datefrom {{ ref('orders') }}where order_date >='2020-01-01'
```

## 'Functional' CTEs[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/2-how-we-style-our-sql?version=1.12#functional-ctes "Direct link to 'Functional' CTEs")
  * ☝🏻 Where performance permits, CTEs should perform a single, logical unit of work.
  * 📖 CTE names should be as verbose as needed to convey what they do e.g. `events_joined_to_users` instead of `user_events` (this could be a good model name, but does not describe a specific function or transformation).
  * 🌉 CTEs that are duplicated across models should be pulled out into their own intermediate models. Look out for chunks of repeated logic that should be refactored into their own model.
  * 🔚 The last line of a model should be a `select *` from your final output CTE. This makes it easy to materialize and audit the output from different steps in the model as you're developing it. You just change the CTE referenced in the `select` statement to see the output from that step.


## Model configuration[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/2-how-we-style-our-sql?version=1.12#model-configuration "Direct link to Model configuration")
  * 📝 Model-specific attributes (like sort/dist keys) should be specified in the model.
  * 📂 If a particular configuration applies to all models in a directory, it should be specified in the `dbt_project.yml` file.
  * 👓 In-model configurations should be specified like this for maximum readability:


```
    config(      materialized ='table',      sort ='id',      dist ='id'
```

## Example SQL[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/2-how-we-style-our-sql?version=1.12#example-sql "Direct link to Example SQL")
```
events as({# CTE comments go here #}filtered_events as(select*from filtered_events
```

### Example SQL[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/2-how-we-style-our-sql?version=1.12#example-sql-1 "Direct link to Example SQL")

## YAML Style Guide[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/5-how-we-style-our-yaml#yaml-style-guide "Direct link to YAML Style Guide")
  * 2️⃣ Indents should be two spaces
  * ➡️ List items should be indented
  * 🔠 List items with a single entry can be a string. For example, `'select': 'other_user'`, but it's best practice to provide the argument as an explicit list. For example, `'select': ['other_user']`
  * 🆕 Use a new line to separate list items that are dictionaries where appropriate
  * 📏 Lines of YAML should be no longer than 80 characters.
  * 🛠️ Use the [dbt JSON schema](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-jsonschema) with any compatible Studio IDE and a YAML formatter (we recommend [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)) to validate your YAML files and format them automatically.


Note, refer to [YAML tips](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/dbt-tips#yaml-tips) for more YAML information.
☁️ As with Python and SQL, the Studio IDE comes with built-in formatting for YAML files (Markdown and JSON too!), via Prettier. Just click the `Format` button and you're in perfect style. As with the other tools, you can [also customize the formatting rules](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/studio-ide/lint-format#format-yaml-markdown-json) to your liking to fit your company's style guide.

Views and tables and incremental models, oh my! In this section we’ll start getting our hands dirty digging into the three basic materializations that ship with dbt. They are considerably less scary and more helpful than lions, tigers, or bears — although perhaps not as cute (can data be cute? We at dbt Labs think so). We’re going to define, implement, and explore:
  * 📚 [**incremental model**](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/materializations#incremental)


👻 There is a fourth default materialization available in dbt called [**ephemeral materialization**](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/materializations#ephemeral). It is less broadly applicable than the other three, and better deployed for specific use cases that require weighing some tradeoffs. We chose to leave it out of this guide and focus on the three materializations that will power 99% of your modeling needs.
**Views and Tables are the two basic categories** of object that we can create across warehouses. They exist natively as types of objects in the warehouse, as you can see from this screenshot of Snowflake (depending on your warehouse the interface will look a little different). **Incremental models** and other materializations types are a little bit different. They tell dbt to **construct tables in a special way**.
### Views[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/materializations/2-available-materializations#views "Direct link to Views")
  * ✅ **The default materialization in dbt**. A starting project has no configurations defined for materializations, which means _everything_ is by default built as a view.
  * 👩‍💻 **Store _only the SQL logic_ of the transformation in the warehouse, _not the data_**. As such, they make a great default. They build almost instantly and cost almost nothing to build.
  * ⏱️ Always reflect the **most up-to-date** version of the input data, as they’re run freshly every time they’re queried.
  * 👎 **Have to be processed every time they’re queried, so slower to return results than a table of the same data.** That also means they can cost more over time, especially if they contain intensive transformations and are queried often.


### Tables[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/materializations/2-available-materializations#tables "Direct link to Tables")
  * 🏗️ **Tables store the data itself** as opposed to views which store the query logic. This means we can pack all of the transformation compute into a single run. A view is storing a _query_ in the warehouse. Even to preview that data we have to query it. A table is storing the literal rows and columns on disk.
  * 🏎️ Querying lets us **access that transformed data directly** , so we get better performance. Tables feel **faster and more responsive** compared to views of the same logic.
  * 💸 **Improves compute costs.** Compute is significantly more expensive than storage. So while tables use much more storage, it’s generally an economical tradeoff, as you only pay for the transformation compute when you build a table during a job, rather than every time you query it.
  * 🔍 **Ideal for models that get queried regularly** , due to the combination of these qualities.
  * 👎 **Limited to the source data that was available when we did our most recent run.** We’re ‘freezing’ the transformation logic into a table. So if we run a model as a table every hour, at 10:59a we still only have data up to 10a, because that was what was available in our source data when we ran the table last at 10a. Only at the next run will the newer data be included in our rebuild.


### Incremental models[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/materializations/2-available-materializations#incremental-models "Direct link to Incremental models")
  * 🧱 **Incremental** models build a **table** in **pieces over time** , only adding and updating new or changed records.
  * 🏎️ **Builds more quickly** than a regular table of the same logic.
  * 🐢 **Initial runs are slow.** Typically we use incremental models on very large datasets, so building the initial table on the full dataset is time consuming and equivalent to the table materialization.
  * 👎 **Add complexity.** Incremental models require deeper consideration of layering and timing.
  * 👎 Can drift from source data over time. As we’re not processing all of the source data when we run an incremental model, extra effort is required to capture changes to historical data.


### Comparing the materialization types[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/materializations/2-available-materializations#comparing-the-materialization-types "Direct link to Comparing the materialization types")
view | table | incremental
---|---|---
🛠️⌛ **build time** | 💚 fastest — only stores logic | ❤️ slowest — linear to size of data | 💛 medium — builds flexible portion
🛠️💸 **build costs** | 💚 lowest — no data processed | ❤️ highest — all data processed | 💛 medium — some data processed
📊💸 **query costs** | ❤️ higher — reprocess every query | 💚 lower — data in warehouse | 💚 lower — data in warehouse
🍅🌱 **freshness** | 💚 best — up-to-the-minute of query | 💛 moderate — up to most recent build | 💛 moderate — up to most recent build
🧠🤔 **complexity** | 💚 simple - maps to warehouse object | 💚 simple - map to warehouse concept | 💛 moderate - adds logical complexity
Loading table...

🔑 **Time is money.** Notice in the above chart that the time and costs rows contain the same results. This is to highlight that when we’re talking about time in warehouses, we’re talking about compute time, which is the primary driver of costs.

## BYO Styles[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/6-how-we-style-conclusion?version=1.12#byo-styles "Direct link to BYO Styles")
Now that you've seen how we style our dbt projects, it's time to build your own. Feel free to copy this guide and use it as a template for your own project. If you do, we'd love to hear about it! Reach out to us on [the Community Forum](https://discourse.getdbt.com/c/show-and-tell/22) or [Slack](https://www.getdbt.com/community) to share your style guide. We recommend co-locating your style guide with your code to make sure contributors can easily follow it. If you're using GitHub, you can add your style guide to your repository's wiki, or include it in your README.
## Pre-commit hooks[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/6-how-we-style-conclusion?version=1.12#pre-commit-hooks "Direct link to Pre-commit hooks")
You can use [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/) to automatically check your code for style violations (and often fix them automagically) before you commit. This is a great way to make sure all contributors follow your style guide. We recommend implementing this once you've settled on and published your style guide, and your codebase is conforming to it. This will ensure that all future commits follow the style guide. You can find an excellent set of open source pre-commit hooks for dbt from the community [here in the dbt-checkpoint project](https://github.com/dbt-checkpoint/dbt-checkpoint).
## dbt Project Evaluator[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/6-how-we-style-conclusion?version=1.12#dbt-project-evaluator "Direct link to dbt Project Evaluator")
The [`dbt_project_evaluator`](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-project-evaluator) is a package that ensures compliance to [dbt's style guide and best practices](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview). The `dbt_project_evaluator` package highlights areas of a dbt project that are not aligned with dbt's best practices and provides recommendations on how to improve a project. This enables analytics engineers to determine exactly where their projects deviated from dbt's best practices and improve their projects on their own. The `dbt_project_evaluator` package covers the following categories:
  * Modeling
  * Testing
  * Documentation
  * Structure
  * Performance
  * Governance

# dbt Example Style Guide## SQL Style- Use lowercase keywords.- Use trailing commas.## Model OrganizationOur models (typically) fit into two main categories:\- Staging &mdash; Contains models that clean and standardize data.        - Marts &mdash; Contains models which combine or heavily transform data. Things to note:- There are different types of models that typically exist in each of the above categories. See  for more information.- Read How we structure our dbt projects[](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview) for an example and more details around organization.## Model Layers- Only models in `staging` should select from .- Models not in the `staging` folder should select from .## Model File Naming and Coding- All objects should be plural.    Example: `stg_stripe__invoices.sql` vs. `stg_stripe__invoice.sql`- All models should use the naming convention `<type/dag_stage>_<source/topic>__<additional_context>`. See  for more information.- Models in the **staging** folder should use the source's name as the `<source/topic>` and the entity name as the `additional_context`.    Examples:    - seed_snowflake_spend.csv    - base_stripe\_\_invoices.sql    - stg_stripe\_\_customers.sql    - stg_salesforce\_\_customers.sql    - int_customers\_\_unioned.sql    - fct_orders.sql- Schema, table, and column names should be in `snake_case`.- Limit the use of abbreviations that are related to domain knowledge. An onboarding employee will understand `current_order_status` better than `current_os`.- Use names based on the _business_ rather than the source terminology.- Each model should have a primary key to identify the unique row and should be named `<object>_id`. For example, `account_id`. This makes it easier to know what `id` is referenced in downstream joined models.- For `base` or `staging` models, columns should be ordered in categories, where identifiers are first and date/time fields are at the end.- Date/time columns should be named according to these conventions:- Timestamps: `<event>_at`    Format: UTC      Example: `created_at`- Dates: `<event>_date`    Format: Date      Example: `created_date`- Booleans should be prefixed with `is_` or `has_`.  Example: `is_active_customer` and `has_admin_access`- Price/revenue fields should be in decimal currency (for example, `19.99` for $19.99; many app databases store prices as integers in cents). If a non-decimal currency is used, indicate this with suffixes. For example, `price_in_cents`.- Avoid using reserved words (such as  for Snowflake) as column names.- Consistency is key! Use the same field names across models where possible. For example, a key to the `customers` table should be named `customer_id` rather than `user_id`.## Model Configurations- Model configurations at the  should be considered (and if applicable, applied) first.- More specific configurations should be applied at the model level using one of these methods[](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/model-configs#apply-configurations-to-one-model-only).- Models within the `marts` folder should be materialized as `table` or `incremental`.- By default, `marts` should be materialized as `table` within `dbt_project.yml`.- If switching to `incremental`, this should be specified in the model's configuration.## Testing- At a minimum, `unique` and `not_null` tests should be applied to the expected primary key of each model.## CTEsFor more information about why we use so many CTEs, read .- Where performance permits, CTEs should perform a single, logical unit of work.- CTE names should be as verbose as needed to convey what they do.- CTEs with confusing or noteable logic should be commented with SQL comments as you would with any complex functions and should be located above the CTE.- CTEs duplicated across models should be pulled out and created as their own models.

On this page
So far we’ve looked at tables and views, which map to the traditional objects in the data warehouse. As mentioned earlier, incremental models are a little different. This is where we start to deviate from this pattern with more powerful and complex materializations.
  * 📚 **Incremental models generate tables.** They physically persist the data itself to the warehouse, just piece by piece. What’s different is **how we build that table**.
  * 💅 **Only apply our transformations to rows of data with new or updated information** , this maximizes efficiency.
    * 🌍 If we have a very large set of data or compute-intensive transformations, or both, it can be very slow and costly to process the entire corpus of source data being input into a model or chain of models. If instead we can identify _only rows that contain new information_ (that is, **new or updated records**), we then can process just those rows, building our models _incrementally_.
  * 3️⃣ We need **3 key things** in order to accomplish the above:
    * a **filter** to select just the new or updated records
    * a **conditional block** that wraps our filter and only applies it when we want it
    * **configuration** that tells dbt we want to build incrementally and helps apply the conditional filter when needed


Let’s dig into how exactly we can do that in dbt. Let’s say we have an `orders` table that looks like the below:
order_id | order_status | customer_id | order_item_id | ordered_at | updated_at
---|---|---|---|---|---
123 | shipped | 7 | 5791 | 2022-01-30 | 2022-01-30
234 | confirmed | 15 | 1643 | 2022-01-31 | 2022-01-31
Loading table...
---
We did our last `dbt build` job on `2022-01-31`, so any new orders since that run won’t appear in our table. When we do our next run (for simplicity let’s say the next day, although for an orders model we’d more realistically run this hourly), we have two options:
  * 🏔️ build the table from the **beginning of time again — a _table materialization_**
    * Simple and solid, if we can afford to do it (in terms of time, compute, and money — which are all directly correlated in a cloud warehouse). It’s the easiest and most accurate option.
  * 🤏 find a way to run **just new and updated rows since our previous run — _an_ _incremental materialization_**
    * If we _can’t_ realistically afford to run the whole table — due to complex transformations or big source data, it takes too long — then we want to build incrementally. We want to just transform and add the row with id 567 below, _not_ the previous two with ids 123 and 234 that are already in the table.


order_id | order_status | customer_id | order_item_id | ordered_at | updated_at
---|---|---|---|---|---
123 | shipped | 7 | 5791 | 2022-01-30 | 2022-01-30
234 | confirmed | 15 | 1643 | 2022-01-31 | 2022-01-31
567 | shipped | 61 | 28 | 2022-02-01 | 2022-02-01

### Writing incremental logic[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/materializations/4-incremental-models?version=1.12#writing-incremental-logic "Direct link to Writing incremental logic")
Let’s think through the information we’d need to build such a model that only processes new and updated data. We would need:
  * 🕜 **a timestamp indicating when a record was last updated** , let’s call it our `updated_at` timestamp, as that’s a typical convention and what we have in our example above.
  * ⌛ the **most recent timestamp from this table _in our warehouse_** _—_ that is, the one created by the previous run — to act as a cutoff point. We’ll call the model we’re working in `this`, for ‘this model we’re working in’.


That would lets us construct logic like this:
```
select*from orders  updated_at (selectmax(updated_at)from {{ this }})
```

Let’s break down that `where` clause a bit, because this is where the action is with incremental models. Stepping through the code **_right-to-left_** we:
  1. Get our **cutoff.**
    1. Select the `max(updated_at)` timestamp — the **most recent record**
    2. from `{{ this }}` — the table for this model as it exists in the warehouse, as **built in our last run** ,
    3. so `max(updated_at) from {{ this }}` the **_most recent record processed in our last run,_**
    4. that’s exactly what we want as a **cutoff**!
  2. **Filter** the rows we’re selecting to add in this run.
    1. Use the `updated_at` timestamp from our input, the equivalent column to the one in the warehouse, but in the up-to-the-minute **source data we’re selecting from** and
    2. check if it’s **greater than our cutoff,**
    3. if so it will satisfy our where clause, so we’re **selecting all the rows more recent than our cutoff.**


This logic would let us isolate and apply our transformations to just the records that have come in since our last run, and I’ve got some great news: that magic `{{ this }}` keyword [does in fact exist in dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/this), so we can write exactly this logic in our models.
### Configuring incremental models[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/materializations/4-incremental-models?version=1.12#configuring-incremental-models "Direct link to Configuring incremental models")
So we’ve found a way to isolate the new rows we need to process. How then do we handle the rest? We still need to:
  * ➕ make sure dbt knows to **_add_ new rows on top** of the existing table in the warehouse, **not replace** it.
  * 👉 If there are **updated rows** , we need a way for dbt to know **which rows to update**.
  * 🌍 Lastly, if we’re building into a new environment and there’s **no previous run to reference** , or we need to **build the model from scratch.** Put another way, we’ll want a means to skip the incremental logic and transform all of our input data like a regular table if needed.
  * 😎 **Visualized below** , we’ve figured out how to get the red ‘new records’ portion selected, but we need to sort out the step to the right, where we stick those on to our model.


😌 Incremental models can be confusing at first, **take your time reviewing** this visual and the previous steps until you have a **clear mental model.** Be patient with yourself. This materialization will become second nature soon, but it’s tough at first. If you’re feeling confused the [dbt Community is here for you on the Forum and Slack](https://www.getdbt.com/community/join-the-community).
Thankfully dbt has some additional configuration and special syntax just for incremental models.
First, let's look at a config block for incremental materialization:
```
    config(        materialized='incremental',        unique_key='order_id'select...
```

  * 📚 The **`materialized`config** works just like tables and views, we just pass it the value `'incremental'`.
  * 🔑 We’ve **added a new config option`unique_key` ,** that tells dbt that if it finds a record in our previous run — the data in the warehouse already — with the same unique id (in our case `order_id` for our `orders` table) that exists in the new data we’re adding incrementally, to **update that record instead of adding it as a separate row**.
  * 👯 This **hugely broadens the types of data we can build incrementally** from just immutable tables (data where rows only ever get added, never updated) to mutable records (where rows might change over time). As long as we’ve got a column that specifies when records were updated (such as `updated_at` in our example), we can handle almost anything.
  * ➕ We’re now **adding records** to the table **and updating existing rows**. That’s 2 of 3 concerns.
  * 🆕 We still need to **build the table from scratch** (via `dbt build` or `run` in a job) when necessary — whether because we’re in a new environment so don’t have an initial table to build on, or our model has drifted from the original over time due to data loading latency.
  * 🔀 We need to wrap our incremental logic, that is our `where` clause with our `updated_at` cutoff, in a **conditional statement that will only apply it when certain conditions are met**. If you’re thinking this is **a case for a Jinja`{% if %}` statement**, you’re absolutely right!


### Incremental conditions[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/materializations/4-incremental-models?version=1.12#incremental-conditions "Direct link to Incremental conditions")
So we’re going to use an **if statement** to apply our cutoff filter **only when certain conditions are met**. We want to apply our cutoff filter _if_ the **following things are true** :
  * ➕ we’ve set the materialization **config** to incremental,
  * 🛠️ there is an **existing table** for this model in the warehouse to build on,
  * 🙅‍♀️ and the `--full-refresh` **flag was _not_ passed.**
    * [full refresh](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/full_refresh) is a configuration and flag that is specifically designed to let us override the incremental materialization and build a table from scratch again.


Thankfully, we don’t have to dig into the guts of dbt to sort out each of these conditions individually.
  * ⚙️ dbt provides us with a **macro[`is_incremental`](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-models#understand-the-is_incremental-macro)** that checks all of these conditions for this exact use case.
  * 🔀 By **wrapping our cutoff logic** in this macro, it will only get applied when the macro returns true for all of the above conditions.


Let’s take a look at all these pieces together:
```
    config(        materialized='incremental',        unique_key='order_id'select*from orders{%if is_incremental()%}  updated_at (selectmax(updated_at)from {{ this }}){% endif %}
```

Fantastic! We’ve got a working incremental model. On our first run, when there is no corresponding table in the warehouse, `is_incremental` will evaluate to false and we’ll capture the entire table. On subsequent runs it will evaluate to true and we’ll apply our filter logic, capturing only the newer data.
### Late-arriving facts[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/materializations/4-incremental-models?version=1.12#late-arriving-facts "Direct link to Late-arriving facts")
Our last concern specific to incremental models is what to do when data is inevitably loaded in a less-than-perfect way. Sometimes data loaders will, for a variety of reasons, load data late. Either an entire load comes in late, or some rows come in on a load after those with which they should have. The following is best practice for every incremental model to slow down the drift this can cause.
  * 🕐 For example if most of our records for `2022-01-30` come in the raw schema of our warehouse on the morning of `2022-01-31`, but a handful don’t get loaded til `2022-02-02`, how might we tackle that? There will already be `max(updated_at)` timestamps of `2022-01-31` in the warehouse, filtering out those late records. **They’ll never make it to our model.**
  * 🪟 To mitigate this, we can add a **lookback window** to our **cutoff** point. By **subtracting a few days** from the `max(updated_at)`, we would capture any late data within the window of what we subtracted.
  * 👯 As long as we have a **`unique_key`defined in our config** , we’ll simply update existing rows and avoid duplication. We process more data this way, but in a fixed way, and it keeps our model hewing closer to the source data.


#### Using state-aware orchestration with incremental models[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/materializations/4-incremental-models?version=1.12#using-state-aware-orchestration-with-incremental-models "Direct link to Using state-aware orchestration with incremental models")
By default, [state-aware orchestration](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/state-aware-about) detects source freshness by checking warehouse metadata for any new rows. This may cause models to run more often than needed.
To avoid this issue, configure a `loaded_at_field` for a specific timestamp column or use a `loaded_at_query` with custom SQL to tell dbt which field to check for freshness. This helps state-aware orchestration to detect only genuinely new data. For information on how to configure `loaded_at_field` and `loaded_at_query`, refer to [Source freshness](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/freshness) and [Advanced configurations](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/state-aware-setup#advanced-configurations).
Even with a `loaded_at_field` or `loaded_at_query`, late arriving records may have an earlier event timestamp (for example, `event_date`). In this case, state-aware orchestration may skip rebuilding the incremental model, even though your lookback window would normally pick up those records. To ensure late-arriving data is detected, configure your `loaded_at_query` to align with the same lookback window used in your incremental filter. For example, if your incremental model uses a 3-day lookback window:
```
sources:-name: raw_orderstables:-name: ordersconfig:loaded_at_query:|            select max(ingested_at)            from {{ this }}            where ingested_at >= current_timestamp - interval '3 days'
```

### Long-term considerations[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/materializations/4-incremental-models?version=1.12#long-term-considerations "Direct link to Long-term considerations")
Late arriving facts point to the biggest tradeoff with incremental models:
  * 🪢 In addition to extra **complexity** , they also inevitably **drift from the source data over time.** Due to the imperfection of loaders and the reality of late arriving facts, we can’t help but miss some day in-between our incremental runs, and this accumulates.
  * 🪟 We can slow this entropy with the lookback window described above — **the longer the window the less efficient the model, but the slower the drift.** It’s important to note it will still occur though, however slowly. If we have a lookback window of 3 days, and a record comes in 4 days late from the loader, we’re still going to miss it.
  * 🌍 Thankfully, there is a way we can reset the relationship of the model to the source data. We can run the model with the **`--full-refresh`flag passed** (such as `dbt build --full-refresh -s orders`). As we saw in the `is_incremental` conditions above, that will make our logic return false, and our `where` clause filter will not be applied, running the whole table.
  * 🏗️ This will let us **rebuild the entire table from scratch,** a good practice to do regularly **if the size of the data will allow**.
  * 📆 A common pattern for incremental models of manageable size is to run a **full refresh on the weekend** (or any low point in activity), either **weekly or monthly** , to consistently reset the drift from late arriving facts.

On this page
First, let’s consider some properties of various levels of our dbt project and materializations.
  * 🔍 **Views** return the freshest, real-time state of their input data when they’re queried, this makes them ideal as **building blocks** for larger models.
    * 🧶 When we’re building a model that stitches lots of other models together, we don’t want to worry about all those models having different states of freshness because they were built into tables at different times. We want all those inputs to give us all the underlying source data available.
  * 🤏 **Views** are also great for **small datasets** with minimally intensive logic that we want **near realtime** access to.
  * 🛠️ **Tables** are the **most performant** materialization, as they just return the transformed data when they’re queried, with no need to reprocess it.
    * 📊 This makes tables great for **things end users touch** , like a mart that services a popular dashboard.
    * 💪 Tables are also ideal for **frequently used, compute intensive** transformations. Making a table allows us to ‘freeze’ those transformations in place.
  * 📚 **Incremental models** are useful for the **same purposes as tables** , they just enable us to build them on larger datasets, so they can be **built** _and_ **accessed** in a **performant** way.


### Project-level configuration[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/materializations/5-best-practices#project-level-configuration "Direct link to Project-level configuration")
Keeping these principles in mind, we can applying these materializations to a project. Earlier we looked at how to configure an individual model's materializations. In practice though, we'll want to set materializations at the folder level, and use individual model configs to override those as needed. This will keep our code DRY and avoid repeating the same config blocks in every model.
  * 📂 In the `dbt_project.yml` we have a `models:` section (by default at the bottom of the file) we can use define various **configurations for entire directories**.
  * ⚙️ These are the **same configs that are passed to a`{{ config() }}` block** for individual models, but they get set for _every model in that directory and any subdirectories nested within it_.
  * ➕ We demarcate between a folder name and a configuration by using a `+`, so `marketing`, `paid_ads`, and `google` below are folder names, whereas **`+materialized`is a configuration** being applied to those folder and all folders nested below them.
  * ⛲ Configurations set in this way **cascade** , the **more specific scope** is the one that will be set.
  * 👇🏻 In the example below, all the models in the `marketing` and `paid_ads` folders would be views, but the `google` sub folder would be **tables.**


```
models:jaffle_shop:marketing:+materialized: viewpaid_ads:google:+materialized: table
```

### Staging views[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/materializations/5-best-practices#staging-views "Direct link to Staging views")
We’ll start off simple with staging models. Lets consider some aspects of staging models to determine the ideal materialization strategy:
  * 🙅‍♀️ Staging models are **rarely accessed** directly by our **end users.**
  * 🧱 They need to be always up-to-date and in sync with our source data as a **building blocks** for later models
  * 🔍 It’s clear we’ll want to keep our **staging models as views**.
  * 👍 Since views are the **default materialization** in dbt, we don’t _have_ to do any specific configuration for this.
  * 💎 Still, for clarity, it’s a **good idea** to go ahead and **specify the configuration** to be explicit. We’ll want to make sure our `dbt_project.yml` looks like this:


```
models:jaffle_shop:staging:+materialized: view
```

### Table and incremental marts[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/materializations/5-best-practices#table-and-incremental-marts "Direct link to Table and incremental marts")
As we’ve learned, views store only the logic of the transformation in the warehouse, so our runs take only a couple seconds per model (or less). What happens when we go to query the data though?
Our marts are slow to query!
Let’s contrast the same aspects of marts that we considered for staging models to assess the best materialization strategy:
  * 📊 Marts are **frequently accessed directly by our end users** , and need to be **performant.**
  * ⌛ Can often **function with intermittently refreshed data** , end user decision making in many domains is **fine with hourly or daily data.**
  * 🛠️ Given the above properties we’ve got a great use case for **building the data itself** into the warehouse, not the logic. In other words, **a table**.
  * ❓ The only decision we need to make with our marts is whether we can **process the whole table at once or do we need to do it in chunks** , that is, are we going to use the `table` materialization or `incremental`.


🔑 **Golden Rule of Materializations** Start with models as views, when they take too long to query, make them tables, when the tables take too long to build, make them incremental.

On this page
## Examining our builds[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/materializations/6-examining-builds#examining-our-builds "Direct link to Examining our builds")
  * ⌚ dbt keeps track of how **long each model took to build** , when it started, when it finished, its completion status (error, warn, or success), its materialization type, and _much_ more.
  * 🖼️ This information is stored in a couple files which dbt calls **artifacts**.
  * 📊 Artifacts contain a ton of information in JSON format, so aren’t easy to read, but **dbt** packages the most useful bits of information into a tidy **visualization** for you.
  * ☁️ If you’re not using Cloud, we can still use the output of the **dbt Core CLI to understand our runs**.


### Model timing[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/materializations/6-examining-builds#model-timing "Direct link to Model timing")
That’s where dbt’s Model Timing visualization comes in extremely handy. If we’ve set up a [Job](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/bigquery) in dbt to run our models, we can use the Model Timing tab to pinpoint our longest-running models.
  * 🧵 This view lets us see our **mapped out in threads** (up to 64 threads, we’re currently running with 4, so we get 4 tracks) over time. You can think of **each thread as a lane on a highway**.
  * ⌛ We can see above that `stg_order_items` and `order_items` are **taking the most time** , so we may want to go ahead and **make that incremental**.
  * 1️⃣ If a job has a single dbt invocation (for example `dbt build`), the model timing chart reflects the timing of all models.
  * 🔢 If a job includes multiple dbt commands (for example, `dbt build` followed by `dbt compile`), the model timing chart reflects only the models from the final command (`dbt compile`). For models executed in both commands, the chart displays the timing from the last invocation. Models that were not re-invoked in the final command retain their timing from the earlier command (`dbt build`).


If you aren’t using dbt, that’s okay! We don’t get a fancy visualization out of the box, but we can use the output from the dbt Core CLI to check our model times, and it’s a great opportunity to become familiar with that output.
### dbt Core CLI output[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/materializations/6-examining-builds#dbt-core-cli-output "Direct link to dbt Core CLI output")
If you’ve ever run dbt, whether `build`, `test`, `run` or something else, you’ve seen some output like below. Let’s take a closer look at how to read this.
  * There are two entries per model, the **start** of a model’s build and the **completion** , which will include **how long** the model took to run. The **type** of model is included as well. For example:


```
20:24:51  5 of 10 START sql view model main.stg_products ......... [RUN]20:24:51  5 of 10 OK created sql view model main.stg_products ....[OK in0.13s]
```

  * 5️⃣ On **both rows** we can see that our `stg_products` model is the 5th of 10 objects being built, the timestamp it started at, that it was defined in SQL (as opposed to python), and that it was a view.
  * 🆕 On the **first row** we can see the timestamp of when the model **started**.
  * ✅ On the **second row** — which does _not_ necessarily come right after, thanks to threads other models can be starting and finishing as this model runs — we see the **completion** entry which adds the **status** , in this case `OK` , and the **time to build** , a lightning-fast 0.13s. That’s not unexpected considering what we know about views.
  * 🏎️ **Views should typically take less than a second or two,** it’s tables and incremental models you’ll want to keep a closer eye on with these tools.


### dbt Artifacts package[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/materializations/6-examining-builds#dbt-artifacts-package "Direct link to dbt Artifacts package")
  * 🎨 Lastly, when it comes to examining your dbt runs, you’re **not stuck without fancy visuals** if you’re using dbt Core. It’s not set up out-of-the-box, but if you want to introspect your project more deeply, you can use the [dbt Artifacts package](https://github.com/brooklyn-data/dbt_artifacts).
  * 👩‍🎨 This provides models you can **visualize for every aspect of your project** at a very granular level.
  * ⌚ You can use it to **create your own model timing visualization** in your BI tool, and any other reports you need to keep an eye on your materialization strategy.

What _really_ happens when you type `dbt build`? Contrary to popular belief, a crack team of microscopic data elves do _not_ construct your data row by row, although the truth feels equally magical. This guide explores the real answer to that question, with an introductory look at the objects that get built into your warehouse, why they matter, and how dbt knows what to build.
For video tutorials on Snapshots, go to dbt Learn and check out the [Snapshots course](https://learn.getdbt.com/courses/snapshots).
The configurations that tell dbt how to construct these objects are called _materializations,_ and knowing how to use them is a crucial skill for effective analytics engineering. When you’ve completed this guide, you will have that ability to use the three core materializations that cover most common analytics engineering situations.
😌 **Materializations abstract away DDL and DML**. Typically in raw SQL- or python-based [data transformation](https://www.getdbt.com/analytics-engineering/transformation/), you have to write specific imperative instructions on how to build or modify your data objects. dbt’s materializations make this declarative, we tell dbt how we want things to be constructed and it figures out how to do that given the unique conditions and qualities of our warehouse.
### Learning goals[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/materializations/1-guide-overview?version=1.12#learning-goals "Direct link to Learning goals")
By the end of this guide you should have a solid understanding of:
  * 🛠️ what **materializations** are
  * 👨‍👨‍👧 how the three main materializations that ship with dbt — **table** , **view** , and **incremental** — differ
  * 🗺️ **when** and **where** to use specific materializations to optimize your development and production builds
  * ⚙️ how to **configure materializations** at various scopes, from an individual model to entire folder


### Prerequisites[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/materializations/1-guide-overview?version=1.12#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")
  * 📒 You’ll want to have worked through the [quickstart guide](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides) and have a project setup to work through these concepts.
  * 🏃🏻‍♀️ Concepts like dbt runs, `ref()` statements, and models should be familiar to you.
  * 🔧 [**Optional**] Reading through the [How we structure our dbt projects](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview) Guide will be beneficial for the last section of this guide, when we review best practices for materializations using the dbt project approach of staging models and marts.


### Guiding principle[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/materializations/1-guide-overview?version=1.12#guiding-principle "Direct link to Guiding principle")
We’ll explore this in-depth throughout, but the basic guideline is **start as simple as possible**. We’ll follow a tiered approached, only moving up a tier when it’s necessary.
  * 🔍 **Start with a view.** When the view gets too long to _query_ for end users,
  * ⚒️ **Make it a table.** When the table gets too long to _build_ in your dbt Jobs,
  * 📚 **Build it incrementally.** That is, layer the data on in chunks as it comes in.

## Configuring materializations[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/materializations/3-configuring-materializations?version=1.12#configuring-materializations "Direct link to Configuring materializations")
Choosing which materialization is as simple as setting any other configuration in dbt. We’ll look first at how we select our materializations for individual models, then at more powerful ways of setting materializations for entire folders of models.
### Configuring tables and views[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/materializations/3-configuring-materializations?version=1.12#configuring-tables-and-views "Direct link to Configuring tables and views")
Let’s look at how we can use tables and views to get started with materializations:
  * ⚙️ We can configure an individual model’s materialization using a **Jinja`config` block**, and passing in the **`materialized`argument**. This tells dbt what materialization to use.
  * 🚰 The underlying specifics of what is run depends on [which **adapter** you’re using](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/supported-data-platforms), but the end results will be equivalent.
  * 😌 This is one of the many valuable aspects of dbt: it lets us use a **declarative** approach, specifying the _outcome_ that we want in our code, rather than _specific steps_ to achieve it (the latter is an _imperative_ approach if you want to get computer science-y about it 🤓).
  * 🔍 In the below case, we want to create a SQL **view** , and can **declare** that in a **single line of code**. Note that python models [do not support materializing as views](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/materializations#python-materializations) at this time.


```
        config(            materialized='view'select...
```

🐍 **Not all adapters support python yet** , check the [docs here to be sure](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/python-models#specific-data-platforms) before spending time writing python models.
  * Configuring a model to materialize as a `table` is simple, and possible for both SQL and python models.


  * SQL
  * Python


```
    config(        materialized='table'select...
```

```
defmodel(dbt, session):    dbt.config(materialized="table")# model logicreturn model_df
```

Go ahead and try some of these out!

You're now following best practices in your project, and have optimized the materializations of your DAG. You’re equipped with the 3 main materializations that cover almost any analytics engineering situation!
There are more configs and materializations available, as well as specific materializations for certain platforms and adapters — and like everything with dbt, materializations are extensible, meaning you can create your own [custom materializations](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/create-new-materializations) for your needs. So this is just the beginning of what you can do with these powerful configurations.
For the vast majority of users and companies though, tables, views, and incremental models will handle everything you can throw at them. Develop your intuition and expertise for these materializations, and you’ll be well on your way to tackling advanced analytics engineering problems.

On this page
## Getting started[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-2-setup?version=1.12#getting-started "Direct link to Getting started")
There are two options for developing a dbt project, including the Semantic Layer:
  * [dbt CLI](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/cloud-cli-installation) — MetricFlow commands are embedded in the dbt CLI under the `dbt sl` subcommand. This is the easiest, most full-featured way to develop Semantic Layer code for the time being. You can use the editor of your choice and run commands from the terminal.
  * [Studio IDE](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/studio-ide/develop-in-studio) — You can create semantic models and metrics in the Studio IDE.


## Basic commands[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-2-setup?version=1.12#basic-commands "Direct link to Basic commands")
  * 🔍 A less common command that will come in handy with the Semantic Layer is `dbt parse`. This will parse your project and generate a **semantic manifest** , a representation of meaningful connections described by your project. This is uploaded to dbt, and used for running `dbt sl` commands in development. This file gives MetricFlow a **state of the world from which to generate queries**.
  * 🧰 `dbt sl query` is your other best friend, it will execute a query against your semantic layer and return a sample of the results. This is great for testing your semantic models and metrics as you build them. For example, if you're building a revenue model you can run `dbt sl query --metrics revenue --group-by metric_time__month` to validate that monthly revenue is calculating correctly.
  * 📝 Lastly, `dbt sl list dimensions --metrics [metric name]` will list all the dimensions available for a given metric. This is useful for checking that you're increasing dimensionality as you progress. You can `dbt sl list` other aspects of your Semantic Layer as well, run `dbt sl list --help` for the full list of options.


For more information on the available commands, refer to the [MetricFlow commands](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/metricflow-commands) reference, or use `dbt sl --help` and `dbt sl [subcommand] --help` on the command line. If you need to set up a dbt project first, check out the [quickstart guides](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/get-started-dbt).
## Onward![​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-2-setup?version=1.12#onward "Direct link to Onward!")
Throughout the rest of the guide, we'll show example code based on the Jaffle Shop project, a fictional chain of restaurants. You can check out the code yourself and try things out in the [Jaffle Shop repository](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle-shop). So if you see us calculating metrics like `food_revenue` later in this guide, this is why!

## BYO Styles[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/6-how-we-style-conclusion?version=1.12#byo-styles "Direct link to BYO Styles")
Now that you've seen how we style our dbt projects, it's time to build your own. Feel free to copy this guide and use it as a template for your own project. If you do, we'd love to hear about it! Reach out to us on [the Community Forum](https://discourse.getdbt.com/c/show-and-tell/22) or [Slack](https://www.getdbt.com/community) to share your style guide. We recommend co-locating your style guide with your code to make sure contributors can easily follow it. If you're using GitHub, you can add your style guide to your repository's wiki, or include it in your README.
## Pre-commit hooks[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/6-how-we-style-conclusion?version=1.12#pre-commit-hooks "Direct link to Pre-commit hooks")
You can use [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/) to automatically check your code for style violations (and often fix them automagically) before you commit. This is a great way to make sure all contributors follow your style guide. We recommend implementing this once you've settled on and published your style guide, and your codebase is conforming to it. This will ensure that all future commits follow the style guide. You can find an excellent set of open source pre-commit hooks for dbt from the community [here in the dbt-checkpoint project](https://github.com/dbt-checkpoint/dbt-checkpoint).
## dbt Project Evaluator[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/6-how-we-style-conclusion?version=1.12#dbt-project-evaluator "Direct link to dbt Project Evaluator")
The [`dbt_project_evaluator`](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-project-evaluator) is a package that ensures compliance to [dbt's style guide and best practices](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview). The `dbt_project_evaluator` package highlights areas of a dbt project that are not aligned with dbt's best practices and provides recommendations on how to improve a project. This enables analytics engineers to determine exactly where their projects deviated from dbt's best practices and improve their projects on their own. The `dbt_project_evaluator` package covers the following categories:
  * Modeling
  * Testing
  * Documentation
  * Structure
  * Performance
  * Governance


For more information, see [Introducing the dbt_project_evaluator: Automatically evaluate your dbt project for alignment with best practices](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/align-with-dbt-project-evaluator).
## Style guide template[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/6-how-we-style-conclusion?version=1.12#style-guide-template "Direct link to Style guide template")
```
# dbt Example Style Guide## SQL Style- Use lowercase keywords.- Use trailing commas.## Model OrganizationOur models (typically) fit into two main categories:\- Staging &mdash; Contains models that clean and standardize data.        - Marts &mdash; Contains models which combine or heavily transform data. Things to note:- There are different types of models that typically exist in each of the above categories. See  for more information.- Read How we structure our dbt projects[](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview) for an example and more details around organization.## Model Layers- Only models in `staging` should select from .- Models not in the `staging` folder should select from .## Model File Naming and Coding- All objects should be plural.    Example: `stg_stripe__invoices.sql` vs. `stg_stripe__invoice.sql`- All models should use the naming convention `<type/dag_stage>_<source/topic>__<additional_context>`. See  for more information.- Models in the **staging** folder should use the source's name as the `<source/topic>` and the entity name as the `additional_context`.    Examples:    - seed_snowflake_spend.csv    - base_stripe\_\_invoices.sql    - stg_stripe\_\_customers.sql    - stg_salesforce\_\_customers.sql    - int_customers\_\_unioned.sql    - fct_orders.sql- Schema, table, and column names should be in `snake_case`.- Limit the use of abbreviations that are related to domain knowledge. An onboarding employee will understand `current_order_status` better than `current_os`.- Use names based on the _business_ rather than the source terminology.- Each model should have a primary key to identify the unique row and should be named `<object>_id`. For example, `account_id`. This makes it easier to know what `id` is referenced in downstream joined models.- For `base` or `staging` models, columns should be ordered in categories, where identifiers are first and date/time fields are at the end.- Date/time columns should be named according to these conventions:- Timestamps: `<event>_at`    Format: UTC      Example: `created_at`- Dates: `<event>_date`    Format: Date      Example: `created_date`- Booleans should be prefixed with `is_` or `has_`.  Example: `is_active_customer` and `has_admin_access`- Price/revenue fields should be in decimal currency (for example, `19.99` for $19.99; many app databases store prices as integers in cents). If a non-decimal currency is used, indicate this with suffixes. For example, `price_in_cents`.- Avoid using reserved words (such as  for Snowflake) as column names.- Consistency is key! Use the same field names across models where possible. For example, a key to the `customers` table should be named `customer_id` rather than `user_id`.## Model Configurations- Model configurations at the  should be considered (and if applicable, applied) first.- More specific configurations should be applied at the model level using one of these methods[](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/model-configs#apply-configurations-to-one-model-only).- Models within the `marts` folder should be materialized as `table` or `incremental`.- By default, `marts` should be materialized as `table` within `dbt_project.yml`.- If switching to `incremental`, this should be specified in the model's configuration.## Testing- At a minimum, `unique` and `not_null` tests should be applied to the expected primary key of each model.## CTEsFor more information about why we use so many CTEs, read .- Where performance permits, CTEs should perform a single, logical unit of work.- CTE names should be as verbose as needed to convey what they do.- CTEs with confusing or noteable logic should be commented with SQL comments as you would with any complex functions and should be located above the CTE.- CTEs duplicated across models should be pulled out and created as their own models.

On this page
This page uses Snowflake for code examples, but you can adapt the views-only pattern to other warehouses.
For some workloads, the simplest and most "real-time" pattern is to materialize everything as views on top of a continuously updated source table. When transformations are very lightweight and the source is already being updated in near real-time, this can preserve the source's latency almost perfectly.
## When to use the views-only pattern[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#when-to-use-the-views-only-pattern "Direct link to When to use the views-only pattern")
Use this when:
  * Source freshness is already "good enough" (for example, ingestion service or operational system writes into a warehouse table every few seconds or minutes).
  * You have very lightweight transformations, such as:
    * Simple projections / renames
    * One to two joins to small reference table
    * Minimal or no heavy aggregations or window functions
  * You care most about preserving the source table's latency and are willing to trade off some query performance at read time.
  * This works best for small-to-medium tables with simple queries.


Typical examples:
  * Dashboards showing current system status (like active user sessions, current queue depth, or recent device heartbeats) where you need to see the latest data immediately.
  * Event data that you're forwarding to other tools with minimal transformation (raw data with just a bit of normalization, like cleaning up field names or adding a few reference fields).


If your transform logic becomes heavier, multiple teams depend on the data, or you need better cost and performance control, transition to [incremental models](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns) or [dynamic tables/materialized views](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/3-warehouse-native-features). Reserve this pattern for the smallest, most latency‑sensitive use cases.
#### Assumptions[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#assumptions "Direct link to Assumptions")
The examples used in this page assume the following setup:
  * A non‑dbt system (ETL, streaming pipeline, app) is already writing into a warehouse‑resident table such as `raw.realtime_events` or `ops.active_sessions`, and that table meets your service level agreement for latency.
  * Querying that table directly is acceptable from a performance and cost standpoint for your expected concurrency.
  * You don't need dbt to persist intermediate tables; you mainly care about:
    * Consistent SQL logic (column naming, type casting)
    * Tests, contracts, and lineage
    * Exposures to BI / downstream tools


All dbt models in this path are materialized as views, not tables or incremental models.
## Example implementation[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#example-implementation "Direct link to Example implementation")
Here's an example implementation of the views-only pattern, which has the following pattern structure:
  * [Source table](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#source-table-definition) (continuously updated): `raw.realtime_events`
  * [Thin staging view](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#staging-view): `analytics.stg_realtime_events_v`
  * [Domain view(s)](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#domain-view-definition): `analytics.vw_realtime_events_enriched`


### Source table definition[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#source-table-definition "Direct link to Source table definition")
```
# models/sources.ymlversion:2sources:-name: rawschema: rawtables:-name: realtime_eventsdescription:"Continuously updated event table from streaming pipeline."loaded_at_field: event_ts
```

### Staging view[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#staging-view "Direct link to Staging view")
```
-- models/staging/stg_realtime_events.sql{{ config(    materialized ='view'select    event_id,    event_ts::timestamp_ntz   as event_ts,-- Snowflake syntax for type casting    to_date(event_ts)as event_date,    user_id,    event_type,    payloadfrom {{ source('raw','realtime_events') }};
```

### Domain view definition[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#domain-view-definition "Direct link to Domain view definition")
```
-- models/marts/vw_realtime_events_enriched.sql{{ config(    materialized ='view'with base as(select*from {{ ref('stg_realtime_events') }}user_dim as(select        user_id,        user_segment,        signup_datefrom {{ ref('dim_user') }}   -- can be a table or incremental modelselect.event_id,.event_ts,.event_date,.user_id,.user_segment,.event_type,.payloadfrom base as bleftjoin user_dim as uon b.user_id = u.user_id;
```

Downstream tools query `analytics.vw_realtime_events_enriched`. As long as `raw.realtime_events` is continuously updated, this view stack is as fresh as the source.
## Benefits[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#benefits "Direct link to Benefits")
  * Maximum freshness: The view reflects new data as soon as it lands in `raw.realtime_events`.
  * Simple operations: No incremental logic to tune and no extra dbt job needed just to keep the data fresh. You still schedule jobs for tests, docs, and so on.
  * Best for small datasets: Works well when tables are small and queries are simple. Computing the view on the fly is cheap and fast.


## Limitations and risks[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#limitations-and-risks "Direct link to Limitations and risks")
This pattern is only safe under tight constraints and has several important limitations:
  * [Doesn't scale to heavy transformations](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#doesnt-scale-to-heavy-transformations)
  * [No "frozen" intermediate tables](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#no-frozen-intermediate-tables)
  * [Schema change sensitivity](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#schema-change-sensitivity)
  * [Potential impact on operational systems](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#potential-impact-on-operational-systems)


### Doesn't scale to heavy transformations[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#doesnt-scale-to-heavy-transformations "Direct link to Doesn't scale to heavy transformations")
If your logic evolves into large joins, deep view chains, or expensive aggregations, you'll quickly run into performance issues:
  * Every query must re‑execute all the logic.
  * The warehouse has to optimize and execute the full stack of views every time.


In those cases, use either of the following:
  * [Dynamic tables or materialized views](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/3-warehouse-native-features), where appropriate


### No "frozen" intermediate tables[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#no-frozen-intermediate-tables "Direct link to No "frozen" intermediate tables")
Because everything is a view:
  * There's no persisted intermediate layer to debug or profile.
  * You can't easily "rerun yesterday's logic" if upstream data changes—everything always reflects the current state.


### Schema change sensitivity[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#schema-change-sensitivity "Direct link to Schema change sensitivity")
Schema changes in the source table propagate immediately through the view stack, which:
  * Can break downstream BI if columns are dropped or types change.
  * Make tests and model contracts more important, since there’s no batch boundary to catch issues before users see them.


### Potential impact on operational systems[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/5-views-only-pattern?version=1.12#potential-impact-on-operational-systems "Direct link to Potential impact on operational systems")
If the continuously‑updated source is itself a live operational store (not a warehouse landing table), you must be careful not to overload it with analytics queries. In most cases, it is recommended to:
  1. Replicate into a warehouse table first (Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, and so on).
  2. Apply this views‑only pattern within the warehouse, not directly on the Online Transaction Processing system.

On this page
This page uses Snowflake for code examples, but you can adapt the lambda view pattern to other warehouses.
A lambda view pattern combines a batch / incremental fact table with a small near real-time (NRT) slice of very recent data and exposes them through a single view. This is a legacy-but-still-useful pattern some teams have used to deliver near real‑time operational dashboards on top of dbt and a warehouse.
## When to use lambda views[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/4-lambda-views?version=1.12#when-to-use-lambda-views "Direct link to When to use lambda views")
  * You need fresher reads than your normal incremental schedule, but
  * You can't (or don't want to) use [dynamic tables](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/snowflake-configs#dynamic-tables) or [materialized views](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/materializations#materialized-view), or you want to keep logic entirely in dbt SQL. The examples used in this page assume the following setup:


### Assumptions[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/4-lambda-views?version=1.12#assumptions "Direct link to Assumptions")
The examples used in this page assume the following setup:
  * Raw events land continuously into `raw.events` using your warehouse's streaming ingestion feature (like Snowpipe, Databricks Auto Loader, Kafka, or a similar ingestion mechanism).
  * You already maintain an [incremental fact table](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns#incremental-merge-from-append-only-tables) that is rebuilt every few minutes using `incremental_strategy='merge'`.
  * Most dashboards are fine reading from that incremental table, but a small set of operational dashboards want "as‑of‑now" data (for example, the last few minutes of events).


### How this pattern works[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/4-lambda-views?version=1.12#how-this-pattern-works "Direct link to How this pattern works")
  * The base incremental table is rebuilt every few minutes using `incremental_strategy='merge'`.
  * The NRT view is a view that selects only events newer than the max `event_ts` already persisted in the base incremental table.
  * The lambda view `UNION ALL`s the base table and the NRT view, de-duplicating rows based on primary key semantics.


Downstream BI or dashboards query only the lambda view.
## Base incremental table[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/4-lambda-views?version=1.12#base-incremental-table "Direct link to Base incremental table")
You can reuse the incremental `merge` from [Snowflake pattern 1](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns#incremental-merge-from-append-only-tables) as your base table; for completeness:
```
-- models/fct_events.sql{{ config(    materialized ='incremental',    incremental_strategy ='merge',    unique_key ='event_id',    cluster_by =['event_date'],    snowflake_warehouse ='TRANSFORM_WH'with source_events as(select        event_id,        event_ts::timestamp_ntz       as event_ts,        to_date(event_ts)as event_date,        user_id,        event_type,        payloadfrom {{ source('raw','events') }}%if is_incremental()%}-- Only pull new/changed rows since last successful loadwhere event_ts (selectmax(event_ts)from {{ this }})% endif %}select*from source_events;
```

Schedule this model to run, for example, every 5–15 minutes as part of your near real‑time job.
## NRT view: rows more recent than the base table[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/4-lambda-views?version=1.12#nrt-view-rows-more-recent-than-the-base-table "Direct link to NRT view: rows more recent than the base table")
The NRT view returns only events with `event_ts` greater than the maximum timestamp in the base table, so there is no overlap or double counting:
```
-- models/fct_events_nrt.sql{{ config(    materialized ='view'with base_max as(selectmax(event_ts)as max_event_tsfrom {{ ref('fct_events') }}fresh_events as(select.event_id,.event_ts::timestamp_ntz   as event_ts,        to_date(e.event_ts)as event_date,.user_id,.event_type,.payloadfrom {{ source('raw','events') }} as ecrossjoin base_maxwhere e.event_ts  base_max.max_event_tsselect*from fresh_events;
```

Characteristics:
  * No scheduling required — it's just a view over `raw.events` filtered by `max(event_ts)` from `fct_events`.
  * Every query against `fct_events_nrt` scans only "since last batch" data, which should be a small time window (for example, a few minutes or hours, depending on your job cadence).


### Lambda view: single read path for BI[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/4-lambda-views?version=1.12#lambda-view-single-read-path-for-bi "Direct link to Lambda view: single read path for BI")
The lambda view combines historical data from the base incremental table with the most recent events from the NRT view.
```
-- models/fct_events_lambda.sql{{ config(    materialized ='view'select    event_id,    event_ts,    event_date,    user_id,    event_type,    payloadfrom {{ ref('fct_events') }}unionallselect    event_id,    event_ts,    event_date,    user_id,    event_type,    payloadfrom {{ ref('fct_events_nrt') }};
```

Point your BI tools and dashboards to `analytics.fct_events_lambda`. Most data comes from the pre-computed incremental table, while the most recent events (since the last dbt run) come from a live query against `raw.events`.
This approach is outlined in [this original dbt lambda view blog post](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/how-to-create-near-real-time-models-with-just-dbt-sql/1457) which describes how teams like JetBlue wired near real‑time operational dashboards on Snowflake and dbt.
## Considerations[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/4-lambda-views?version=1.12#considerations "Direct link to Considerations")
Take the following into consideration when using this pattern:
  * **Cost profile**
    * Every query against `fct_events_lambda` must read the NRT slice from `raw.events` in addition to the base table.
    * Use this pattern only for truly operational dashboards that justify the extra per‑query cost.
  * **Freshness**
    * Freshness is bounded by:
      * Your dbt incremental job frequency (age of `fct_events`), plus
      * Ingestion latency into `raw.events` (Snowpipe / streaming layer).
  * **Complexity vs alternatives**
    * For many modern Snowflake implementations, a [dynamic table](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/snowflake-configs#dynamic-tables) or [materialized view](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/materializations#materialized-view) with a small `target_lag` can provide similar "always within X minutes" service level agreements with less custom SQL and warehouse‑managed incremental logic.
    * Lambda views are best positioned as an _advanced / legacy pattern_ you can still use for when you:
      * Want all logic in dbt SQL
      * Lack the right warehouse feature in your environment
      * Are extending an existing implementation already built this way

## Python tooling[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/3-how-we-style-our-python?version=1.12#python-tooling "Direct link to Python tooling")
  * 🐍 Python has a more mature and robust ecosystem for formatting and linting (helped by the fact that it doesn't have a million distinct dialects). We recommend using those tools to format and lint your code in the style you prefer.
  * 🛠️ Our current recommendations are
    * [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) formatter
    * [ruff](https://pypi.org/project/ruff/) linter
☁️ dbt comes with the [black formatter built-in](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/studio-ide/lint-format) to automatically lint and format their Python. You don't need to download or configure anything, just click `Format` in a Python model and you're good to go!


## Example Python[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/3-how-we-style-our-python?version=1.12#example-python "Direct link to Example Python")

Modern data warehouses offer native features that can simplify near real-time data patterns. Instead of managing incremental logic yourself, you can declare the desired freshness and let the warehouse handle the refresh mechanics.
This section covers when to use dynamic tables and materialized views instead of incremental models for near real-time data.
  * [Dynamic tables](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/snowflake-configs#dynamic-tables) are a warehouse-specific feature in Snowflake that lets the warehouse keep a table updated for you. You define what the table should look like, and the warehouse keeps the table fresh automatically.
  * [Materialized views](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/materializations#materialized-view) are a warehouse-specific feature that lets the warehouse save the results of a query so they’re faster to read, and refresh them as the underlying data changes. Note that the exact behavior depends on the warehouse.
  * [Incremental models](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-models) are a dbt feature that lets dbt update a table by processing only new data. You tell dbt how new data should be added using your incremental logic SQL, and dbt runs the right SQL when the model is built.


#### When to consider warehouse-native features[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/3-warehouse-native-features?version=1.12#when-to-consider-warehouse-native-features "Direct link to When to consider warehouse-native features")
**Use dynamic tables or materialized views when:**
  * Your requirement is "data always within X minutes of real time" and you don't need precise scheduling control.
  * You want to simplify operational complexity by offloading refresh logic to the warehouse.
  * Your transformations are relatively straightforward.
  * You're willing to trade some control for convenience.


**Stick with incremental models when:**
  * You need fine-grained control over scheduling and refresh logic,
  * You have complex business rules requiring custom incremental strategies (like microbatching).
  * You need to coordinate refreshes across multiple models in a specific order.


## Dynamic tables[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/3-warehouse-native-features?version=1.12#dynamic-tables "Direct link to Dynamic tables")
Dynamic tables are currently supported in Snowflake, with similar features available in other warehouses under different names. Check your warehouse documentation for availability.
With dynamic tables, you can define the target state with SQL, and the warehouse automatically handles incremental refreshes.
For example, the following SQL model uses a dynamic table to keep a table up to date for you:
```
{{ config(    materialized ='dynamic_table',    target_lag ='5 minutes',    snowflake_warehouse ='TRANSFORM_WH'-- Snowflake syntaxselect    event_id,    event_ts::timestamp_ntz as event_ts,    to_date(event_ts)as event_date,    user_id,    event_type,    payloadfrom {{ source('raw','events') }}where event_ts >=current_timestamp()-interval'7 days';
```

#### target_lag config[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/3-warehouse-native-features?version=1.12#target_lag-config "Direct link to target_lag config")
The [`target_lag` parameter](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/snowflake-configs#target-lag) tells the warehouse the maximum acceptable staleness of the dynamic table relative to its sources, and helps determine when the table should be refreshed.
For example:
  * `target_lag = '1 minute'` - Warehouse keeps the table within one minute of its source data, refreshing automatically as needed.
  * `target_lag = '5 minutes'` - Table may lag up to five minutes behind its sources.
  * `target_lag = 'downstream'` - Table refreshes only when a downstream table depends on it.
  * `target_lag = '1 minute'` - Data refreshed to be within 1 minute of the source
  * `target_lag = '5 minutes'` - Data within 5 minutes
  * `target_lag = 'downstream'` - Refresh when downstream tables need it


The warehouse automatically determines when to refresh, whether to do a full or incremental update, and how to optimize the refresh query.
#### Benefits[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/3-warehouse-native-features?version=1.12#benefits "Direct link to Benefits")
  * Declarative freshness: specify "how fresh" not "when to refresh"
  * Warehouse-managed optimization
  * Cost predictability: refreshes run only when needed to meet `target_lag`
  * Simple setup


#### Limitations[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/3-warehouse-native-features?version=1.12#limitations "Direct link to Limitations")
  * Less control over exact timing or orchestration logic
  * Cost visibility can be harder to predict than scheduled dbt jobs
  * Less visibility into refresh decisions compared to dbt's explicit incremental logic
  * Currently warehouse-specific (implementation varies by platform)


## Materialized views[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/3-warehouse-native-features?version=1.12#materialized-views "Direct link to Materialized views")
Materialized views are available in most modern data warehouses and cache query results that automatically refresh when underlying data changes.
Materialized views work like this:
  * The warehouse detects changes to source tables and refreshes the materialized view.
  * Many warehouses can incrementally update the view rather than recomputing everything.
  * Queries against the materialized view read cached results, not the underlying tables.


For example, the following sql model uses a materialized view to keep a table up to date for you:
```
{{ config(    materialized ='materialized_view'select    user_id,    date_trunc('hour', event_ts)as event_hour,count(*)as event_countfrom {{ source('raw','events') }}groupby1,2;
```

On this page
Note that this best practices guide doesn't yet use the [new YAML specification](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/latest-metrics-spec). We're working on updating this guide to use the new spec and file structure soon!
To read more about the new spec, see [Creating metrics](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/metrics-overview).
## Files and Folders[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-7-semantic-structure?version=1.12#files-and-folders "Direct link to Files and Folders")
The first thing you need to establish is how you’re going to consistently structure your code. There are two recommend best practices to choose from:
  * 🏡 **Co-locate your semantic layer code** in a one-YAML-file-per-marts-model system.
    * Puts documentation, data tests, unit tests, semantic models, and metrics into a unified file that corresponds to a dbt-modeled mart.
    * Trades larger file size for less clicking between files.
    * Simpler for greenfield projects that are building the Semantic Layer alongside dbt models.
  * 🏘️**Create a sub-folder** called `models/semantic_models/`.
    * Create a parallel file and folder structure within that specifically for semantic layer code.
    * Gives you more targeted files, but may involves switching between files more often.
    * Better for migrating large existing projects, as you can quickly see what marts have been codified into the Semantic Layer.


It’s not terribly difficult to shift between these (it can be done with some relatively straightforward shell scripting), and this is purely a decision based on your developers’ preference (i.e. it has no impact on execution or performance), so don’t feel locked in to either path. Just pick the one that feels right and you can always shift down the road if you change your mind.
Make sure to save all semantic models and metrics under the directory defined in the [`model-paths`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/project-configs/model-paths) (or a subdirectory of it, like `models/semantic_models/`). If you save them outside of this path, it will result in an empty `semantic_manifest.json` file, and your semantic models or metrics won't be recognized.
## Naming[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-7-semantic-structure?version=1.12#naming "Direct link to Naming")
Next, establish your system for consistent file naming:
  * 1️⃣ If you’re doing **one-YAML-file-per-mart** then you’d have an `orders.sql` and an `orders.yml`.
  * 📛 If you’re using a **parallel subfolder approach** , for the sake of unique file names it’s recommended to use the **prefix`sem_` e.g. `sem_orders.yml`** for the dedicated semantic model and metrics that build on `orders.sql` and `orders.yml`.


## Can't decide?[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-7-semantic-structure?version=1.12#cant-decide "Direct link to Can't decide?")
Start with a dedicated subfolder for your semantic models and metrics, and then if you find that you’re spending a lot of time clicking between files, you can always shift to a one-YAML-file-per-mart system. Our internal data team has found that the dedicated subfolder approach is more manageable for migrating existing projects, and this is the approach our documentation uses, so if you can't pick go with that.

Coordinating model versions across your mesh is a critical part of the model versioning process. This guide will walk you through the safe best practices for coordinating producers and consumers when introducing model versions.
An important part of our dbt Mesh workflow is [model versions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/model-versions). This enables better data model management and is critical in a scenario where multiple teams share models across projects.
Releasing a new model version safely requires coordination between model producers (who build the models) and model consumers (who depend on them).
This guide goes over the following topics:
  * [How producers introduce new model versions safely](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#best-practices-for-producers)
  * [How consumers evaluate and migrate to those new versions](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#best-practices-for-consumers)


For how versioning works at a technical level (YAML structure, contracts, aliasing), see [model versions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/model-versions).
## Best practices for producers[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#best-practices-for-producers "Direct link to Best practices for producers")
Producers own the creation, rollout, communication, and deprecation of model versions. The following steps go over what producers should do when introducing a new version of a model.
  * [Step 1: Decide when a change needs a new version](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#step-1-decide-when-a-changes-needs-a-new-version)
  * [Step 2: Create the new version safely](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#step-2-create-the-new-version-safely)
  * [Step 3: Add a deprecation date](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#step-3-add-a-deprecation-date)
  * [Step 4: Communicate the new version](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#step-4-communicate-the-new-version)
  * [Step 5: Remove the old version](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#step-5-remove-the-old-version)
  * [Step 6: Clean up deprecated versions](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#step-6-clean-up-deprecated-versions)


#### Step 1: Decide when a change needs a new version[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#step-1-decide-when-a-change-needs-a-new-version "Direct link to Step 1: Decide when a change needs a new version")
When creating an original version of a model, use [model contracts](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/model-contracts) to ensure that breaking changes produce errors during development. The model contract ensures you, as a producer, are not changing the shape or data type of the output model. If a change breaks the contract, like removing or changing a column type, this means you should create a new model contract, and thus a new model version.
Here are some examples of breaking changes that might need a new version:
  * Removing a column
  * Renaming a column
  * Changing a column type


Here are some examples of non-breaking changes:
  * Adding a new column
  * Fixing a bug in an existing column


Here are examples of changes that might be breaking depending on your business logic:
  * Changing logic behind a metric
  * Changing granularity
  * Modifying filters
  * Rewriting `CASE` statements


#### Step 2: Create the new version safely[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#step-2-create-the-new-version-safely "Direct link to Step 2: Create the new version safely")
After deciding that a change needs a new [version](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/versions), follow these steps to create the new version without disrupting existing workflows. Let's say you're removing a column:
  1. Create a new version of the model file. For example, `fishtown_analytics_orders_v2.sql`. Each version of a model must have its own SQL file.
  2. Keep the default version stable. In the model's `properties.yml` file:
     * Set [`versions`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/versions) to include the old version and the new version: `- v: 1` and `- v: 2` respectively.
     * Set the [`latest_version:`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/latest_version) to `latest_version: 1`.
This ensures that downstream consumers using `ref(...)` won’t accidentally start using v2. Without setting this, the default will be the highest numerical version, which could be a breaking change for consumers.
  3. Set an [alias](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/alias) or create a view over the latest model version. By aliasing or creating a view over the latest model version, you ensure `fishtown_analytics_orders` (without the version suffix) always exists as an object in the warehouse, pointing to the latest version. This also protects external tools and BI dashboards.


#### Step 3: Add a deprecation date[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#step-3-add-a-deprecation-date "Direct link to Step 3: Add a deprecation date")
  1. In the model's `properties.yml` file, set a [`deprecation_date`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/deprecation_date) for the model's old version. The `deprecation_date` is a date in the future that signifies when the old version will be removed.
This notifies downstream consumers and will appear in the `dbt run` logs as a warning that the old version is nearing deprecation and consumers will need to [migrate](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#best-practices-for-consumers) to the new version.
If your model has an [enforced contract](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/model-contracts), you cannot delete the model until after the `deprecation_date` has passed. dbt doesn't allow deleting models with enforced contracts before their `deprecation_date` to protect downstream consumers.
If you try to delete a versioned model before its `deprecation_date`, dbt will raise an error during development runs and cause jobs to fail.
models/properties.yml
```
models:-name: fishtown_analytics_orderslatest_version:1columns:-name: column_to_remove-name: column_to_keepversions:-v:1# old version — uses all top-level columnsdeprecation_date:"2025-12-31"-v:2# new versioncolumns:-include: allexclude:[column_to_remove]# <— specify which columns were removed in v2
```

  2. Merge the new version into the main branch.
  3. Run the job to build the new version.
  4. Verify that the new version builds successfully.
  5. Verify that the deprecation date is set correctly in the `dbt run` logs.


If you try to reference models (for example, `{{ ref('upstream_project', 'model_name', v=1) }}`) using the `v=1` argument after the deprecation date, the `ref` call will fail once the producer project removes the `v1` version.
#### Step 4: Communicate the new version[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#step-4-communicate-the-new-version "Direct link to Step 4: Communicate the new version")
After creating a new version and setting a deprecation date for the old version, communicate the new version to downstream consumers. Let them know that:
  * A new version is available and a deprecation timeline exists.
  * Consumers can test the new version and [migrate](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#best-practices-for-consumers) over.
  * To test the new version, consumers can use `v=2` when referencing the model. For example, `{{ ref('upstream_project', 'model_name', v=2) }}`.


#### Step 5: Remove the old version[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#step-5-remove-the-old-version "Direct link to Step 5: Remove the old version")
Once the consumers confirm they've tested and migrated over to the new version, you can set the new version as the latest version:
models/properties.yml
```
models:-name: fishtown_analytics_orderslatest_version:2# update from 1 to 2 to set the new version as the latest versionversions:-v:1# this represents the old version-v:2# this represents the new version
```

This then updates the default `ref` to the new version. For example, `{{ ref('upstream_project', 'fishtown_analytics_orders') }}` will now resolve to the `fishtown_analytics_orders_v2` model in the `upstream_project`. If consumers want to use the old version, they can use `v=1` when referencing the model: `{{ ref('upstream_project', 'fishtown_analytics_orders', v=1) }}`.
#### Step 6: Clean up deprecated versions[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#step-6-clean-up-deprecated-versions "Direct link to Step 6: Clean up deprecated versions")
After all consumers have [migrated](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#best-practices-for-consumers) to the new version, you can clean up the deprecated version. You could choose to "hard delete" all old versions, or "soft delete" them for continuity.
If your model has an [enforced contract](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/model-contracts), you cannot delete the model until after the `deprecation_date` has passed. dbt doesn't allow deleting models with enforced contracts before their `deprecation_date` to protect downstream consumers.
If you try to delete a versioned model before its `deprecation_date`, dbt will raise an error during development runs and cause jobs to fail.
  * Hard delete (cleanest)
  * Soft delete (retains continuity)


"Hard deleting" old versions is the cleanest approach and removes all old version artifacts from your project:
  1. Delete the `fishtown_analytics_orders_v1.sql` file and rename the new version back to `fishtown_analytics_orders.sql`.
  2. Delete all version specifications from your `.yml` file.
  3. Drop or delete the `fishtown_analytics_orders_v1` object from your warehouse with a manual script or using a cleanup macro.


"Soft deleting" old versions retains all old version artifacts to avoid confusion if more model versions get introduced in future, and for continuity. Bear in mind that your version control platform will also have the history of all of these changes.
  1. Repoint the `fishtown_analytics_orders` alias to your latest version file (for example, `fishtown_analytics_orders_v2`), or create a view on top of the latest model version.
  2. Use the `enabled` [config option](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/enabled) to disable the deprecated model version so that it doesn’t run in dbt jobs and can’t be referenced in a cross-project ref. For example:
models/properties.yml
```
models:-name: fishtown_analytics_orderslatest_version:1columns:-name: column_to_remove-name: column_to_keepversions:-v:1# old version — uses all top-level columnsdeprecation_date:"2025-12-31"config:enabled:false#  disable deprecated version so it no longer runs-v:2# new versioncolumns:-include: allexclude:[column_to_remove]# <— specify which columns were removed in v2
```

  3. Drop or delete the `fishtown_analytics_orders_v1` object from your warehouse with a manual script or appropriate process or using a cleanup macro.


... and that's it! You should now have a new version of the model and a deprecated version. The next section is meant for consumers to evaluate and migrate to the new version.
## Best practices for consumers[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-6-coordinate-versions?version=1.12#best-practices-for-consumers "Direct link to Best practices for consumers")
Consumers rely on upstream models and need to make sure that version transitions don’t introduce unintended breakages. Refer to the following steps to migrate to the new version:
  1. Begin writing a cross-project reference to use a public model from a different project. In this case, `{{ ref('upstream_project', 'fishtown_analytics_orders') }}`.
  2. Once you see deprecation warnings, test the latest version of a model by explicitly referencing it in your `ref`. For example, `{{ ref('upstream_project', 'fishtown_analytics_orders', v=2) }}`. Check if it's a breaking change for you or has any unintended impacts on your project.
     * If it does, consider explicitly “pinning” to the current, working version of the model before the new version becomes the default: `{{ ref('upstream_project', 'fishtown_analytics_orders', v=1) }}`. Bear in mind that you will need to migrate at some point before the deprecation date.
  3. Before the deprecation date, you can migrate to the new version of the model by removing the version specification in your cross-project reference: `{{ ref('upstream_project', 'fishtown_analytics_orders')`. Make any downstream logic changes needed to accommodate this new version.


Consumers should plan migrations to align with their own team’s release cycles.

## Putting it all together[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-9-conclusion?version=1.12#putting-it-all-together "Direct link to Putting it all together")
  * 📊 We've walked through **creating semantic models and metrics** for basic coverage of a key business area.
  * 🔁 In doing so we've looked at how to **refactor a frozen rollup** into a dynamic, flexible new life in the Semantic Layer.


## Best practices[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-9-conclusion?version=1.12#best-practices "Direct link to Best practices")
  * ✅ **Prefer normalization** when possible to allow MetricFlow to denormalize dynamically for end users.
  * ✅ Use **marts to denormalize** when needed, for instance grouping tables together into richer components, or getting measures on dimensional tables attached to a table with a time spine.
  * ✅ When source data is **well normalized** you can **build semantic models on top of staging models**.
  * ✅ **Prefer** computing values in **measures and metrics** when possible as opposed to in frozen rollups.
  * ❌ **Don't directly refactor the code you have in production** , build in parallel so you can audit the Semantic Layer output and deprecate old marts gracefully.


## Key commands[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-9-conclusion?version=1.12#key-commands "Direct link to Key commands")
  * 🔑 Use `dbt parse` to generate a fresh semantic manifest.
  * 🔑 Use `dbt sl list dimensions --metrics [metric name]` to check that you're increasing dimensionality as you progress.
  * 🔑 Use `dbt sl query [query options]` to preview the output from your metrics as you develop.


## Next steps[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-9-conclusion?version=1.12#next-steps "Direct link to Next steps")
  * 🗺️ Use these best practices to map out your team's plan to **incrementally adopt the Semantic Layer**.
  * 🤗 Get involved in the community and ask questions, **help craft best practices** , and share your progress in building a Semantic Layer.
  * [Validate semantic nodes in CI](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/ci-jobs#semantic-validations-in-ci) to ensure code changes made to dbt models don't break these metrics.


The Semantic Layer is the biggest paradigm shift thus far in the young practice of analytics engineering. It's ready to provide value right away, but is most impactful if you move your project towards increasing normalization, and allow MetricFlow to do the denormalization for you with maximum dimensionality.
We will be releasing more resources soon covering implementation of the Semantic Layer in dbt with various integrated BI tools. This is just the beginning, hopefully this guide has given you a path forward for building your data platform in this new era. Refer to [Semantic Layer FAQs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/sl-faqs) for more information.

## Configuring materializations[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/materializations/3-configuring-materializations?version=1.12#configuring-materializations "Direct link to Configuring materializations")
Choosing which materialization is as simple as setting any other configuration in dbt. We’ll look first at how we select our materializations for individual models, then at more powerful ways of setting materializations for entire folders of models.
### Configuring tables and views[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/materializations/3-configuring-materializations?version=1.12#configuring-tables-and-views "Direct link to Configuring tables and views")
Let’s look at how we can use tables and views to get started with materializations:
  * ⚙️ We can configure an individual model’s materialization using a **Jinja`config` block**, and passing in the **`materialized`argument**. This tells dbt what materialization to use.
  * 🚰 The underlying specifics of what is run depends on [which **adapter** you’re using](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/supported-data-platforms), but the end results will be equivalent.
  * 😌 This is one of the many valuable aspects of dbt: it lets us use a **declarative** approach, specifying the _outcome_ that we want in our code, rather than _specific steps_ to achieve it (the latter is an _imperative_ approach if you want to get computer science-y about it 🤓).
  * 🔍 In the below case, we want to create a SQL **view** , and can **declare** that in a **single line of code**. Note that python models [do not support materializing as views](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/materializations#python-materializations) at this time.


```
        config(            materialized='view'select...
```

🐍 **Not all adapters support python yet** , check the [docs here to be sure](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/python-models#specific-data-platforms) before spending time writing python models.
  * Configuring a model to materialize as a `table` is simple, and possible for both SQL and python models.


  * SQL
  * Python


```
    config(        materialized='table'select...
```

```
defmodel(dbt, session):    dbt.config(materialized="table")# model logicreturn model_df
```

Go ahead and try some of these out!

Teams that implement very high-frequency dbt jobs tend to run into a consistent set of challenges, both at the dbt scheduler layer and in the warehouse itself.
Near real-time service level agreements (SLAs) require premium resources and add significant operational overhead. Pressure-test whether the business really needs minute-level freshness before committing.
## Over-scheduled jobs and queue management[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/6-operational-considerations?version=1.12#over-scheduled-jobs-and-queue-management "Direct link to Over-scheduled jobs and queue management")
If a job's run duration is longer than its schedule frequency, the job becomes over-scheduled. The queue grows faster than the scheduler can process runs, and dbt platform will start cancelling queued runs to avoid an ever-expanding backlog.
This is easy to hit with near real-time patterns if your incremental build time creeps up (more models, more tests, more data) but the cron schedule stays aggressive (for example, every 2–5 minutes).
**Example scenario:**
  * Your job is scheduled to run every 5 minutes.
  * The job typically takes 6-7 minutes to complete.
  * New runs queue up while previous runs are still executing.
  * dbt platform starts cancelling queued runs to prevent infinite backlog.


When this happens, remediation is non-trivial. You need to either refactor the job to run faster (prune model selection, adjust threads, optimize SQL) or relax the schedule and accept a looser freshness SLA.
#### Related scheduler constraints[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/6-operational-considerations?version=1.12#related-scheduler-constraints "Direct link to Related scheduler constraints")
  * Run slots limit how many jobs can run concurrently. Frequent near real-time jobs can starve other deployment jobs if slot usage isn't planned.
  * The scheduler runs distinct executions of the same job serially. If one run is still in progress when the next cron fires, the second run must wait (or be cancelled in an over-scheduled scenario).


## Warehouse cost and utilization[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/6-operational-considerations?version=1.12#warehouse-cost-and-utilization "Direct link to Warehouse cost and utilization")
As the gap between job runtime and schedule interval shrinks, your warehouse is effectively running continuously to keep up with back-to-back transformation windows.
**Cost scaling example:**
  * Daily job: Warehouse runs 30 min/day = ~2% utilization
  * Hourly job: Warehouse runs 30 min × 24 = 12 hours/day = 50% utilization
  * 5-minute job: Warehouse runs nearly 24/7 = ~100% utilization


On platforms like Snowflake, ingestion options like Snowpipe for high-volume real-time feeds can be very expensive (cost per 1,000 files plus compute).
Warehouse-managed options for freshness (for example, dynamic tables and materialized views) can also be harder to predict and monitor from a cost perspective, especially when underlying data is changing frequently.
The net effect: you should treat near real-time SLAs as a premium service and pressure-test whether the business really needs minute-level freshness on each workload.
## Lambda view DAG complexity and correctness[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/6-operational-considerations?version=1.12#lambda-view-dag-complexity-and-correctness "Direct link to Lambda view DAG complexity and correctness")
If you're using the [lambda views pattern](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/4-lambda-views), you face additional complexity:
  * **Duplicated logic** : You either centralize SQL in macros (more DRY, less readable) or duplicate the same transformations in both history (HIST) and NRT flows (more readable, more to maintain).
  * **Complex DAGs** : Every "product" model now has at least three artifacts (HIST table, NRT view, lambda union), plus supporting upstream layers.
  * **Materialization brittleness** : The pattern depends on specific materializations (views vs incrementals). A seemingly harmless materialization change can break freshness or correctness.


On top of that, community experience has surfaced timing gaps between HIST and NRT flows:
  * Views (NRT) often update much faster than incremental tables. During a run, the NRT side may start filtering on the new `max(event_ts)` before the incremental table has finished loading, producing temporary holes in the unioned lambda view where recent data disappears briefly.
  * One way to mitigate is to introduce an explicit dependency from NRT to the incremental model (for example, a manual dependency on `{{ ref('fct_events') }}` comment), but this is somewhat brittle and increases coupling.


## Job reliability and resource limits[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/6-operational-considerations?version=1.12#job-reliability-and-resource-limits "Direct link to Job reliability and resource limits")
High-frequency jobs are more likely to surface job-level failures:
  * **Memory limits**
    * Memory-heavy macros (for example, large `run_query()` results) or big doc-generation steps can hit account-level memory limits.
    * This causes runs to terminate with "memory limit" errors.
  * **Auto-deactivation**
    * A job that fails repeatedly can be auto-deactivated after 100 consecutive failures.
    * When this happens, scheduled triggers stop until someone manually intervenes.
  * **Smaller margin for error**
    * A flaky model, test, or small regression can quickly generate many failed runs.
    * This creates noisy alerts and can hit the auto-deactivation threshold faster.


## Ingestion architecture dependencies[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/6-operational-considerations?version=1.12#ingestion-architecture-dependencies "Direct link to Ingestion architecture dependencies")
Lambda views and NRT dbt jobs sit on top of your ingestion architecture:
  * **The dependency**
    * If ingestion latency or throughput degrades (issues in a task/stream pipeline, backlogs in storage, intermittent Snowpipe delays), the lambda view can only union what has already arrived.
    * You can't make data fresher than your ingestion layer allows.
  * **What you end up tuning**
    * Task cadences and partition strategies in the landing zone
    * Lambda overlap windows and incremental look-backs
    * Which sources really need to participate in the NRT path


## Conclusion[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/6-operational-considerations?version=1.12#conclusion "Direct link to Conclusion")
These challenges are why we position lambda views and ultra-frequent dbt schedules as special-case patterns. They're powerful when you truly need them, but they require deliberate design around scheduler behavior, cost, DAG structure, and ingestion architecture. In many cases, they're better replaced by [dynamic tables](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/3-warehouse-native-features#dynamic-tables), [materialized views](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/3-warehouse-native-features#materialized-views), or a dedicated streaming stack.

Note that this best practices guide doesn't yet use the [new YAML specification](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/latest-metrics-spec). We're working on updating this guide to use the new spec and file structure soon!
To read more about the new spec, see [Creating metrics](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/metrics-overview).
## How to build metrics[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-4-build-metrics?version=1.12#how-to-build-metrics "Direct link to How to build metrics")
  * 💹 We'll start with one of the most important metrics for any business: **revenue**.
  * 📖 For now, our metric for revenue will be **defined as the sum of order totals excluding tax**.


## Defining revenue[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-4-build-metrics?version=1.12#defining-revenue "Direct link to Defining revenue")
  * 🔢 Metrics have four basic properties:
    * `name:` We'll use 'revenue' to reference this metric.
    * `description:` For documentation.
    * `label:` The display name for the metric in downstream tools.
    * `type:` one of `simple`, `ratio`, or `derived`.
  * 🎛️ Each type has different `type_params`.
  * 🛠️ We'll build a **simple metric** first to get the hang of it, and move on to ratio and derived metrics later.
  * 📏 Simple metrics are built on a **single measure defined as a type parameter**.
  * 🔜 Defining **measures as their own distinct component** on semantic models is critical to allowing the **flexibility of more advanced metrics** , though simple metrics act mainly as **pass-through that provide filtering** and labeling options.


models/marts/orders.yml
```
metrics:-name: revenuedescription: Sum of the order total.label: Revenuetype: simpletype_params:measure: order_total
```

## Query your metric[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-4-build-metrics?version=1.12#query-your-metric "Direct link to Query your metric")
You can use the dbt CLI for metric validation or queries during development, via the `dbt sl` set of subcommands. Here are some useful examples:
```
dbt sl query revenue --group-by metric_time__monthdbt sl list dimensions --metrics revenue # list all dimensions available for the revenue metric
```

  * It's best practice any time we're updating our Semantic Layer code to run `dbt parse` to update our development semantic manifest.
  * `dbt sl query` is not how you would typically use the tool in production, that's handled by the dbt Semantic Layer's features. It's available for testing results of various metric queries in development, exactly as we're using it now.
  * Note the structure of the above query. We select the metric(s) we want and the dimensions to group them by — we use dunders (double underscores e.g.`metric_time__[time bucket]`) to designate time dimensions or other non-unique dimensions that need a specified entity path to resolve (e.g. if you have an orders location dimension and an employee location dimension both named 'location' you would need dunders to specify `orders__location` or `employee__location`).

Our guidance here diverges if you use the Semantic Layer. In a project without the Semantic Layer we recommend you denormalize heavily, per the best practices below. On the other hand, if you're using the Semantic Layer, we want to stay as normalized as possible to allow MetricFlow the most flexibility. See [The dbt Semantic Layer and marts](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/4-marts?version=1.12#the-dbt-semantic-layer-and-marts) for more information.
This is the layer where everything comes together and we start to arrange all of our atoms (staging models) and molecules (intermediate models) into full-fledged cells that have identity and purpose. We sometimes like to call this the _entity_ _layer_ or _concept layer_ , to emphasize that all our marts are meant to represent a specific entity or concept at its unique grain. For instance, an order, a customer, a territory, a click event, a payment — each of these would be represented with a distinct mart, and each row would represent a discrete instance of these concepts. Unlike in a traditional Kimball star schema though, in modern data warehousing — where storage is cheap and compute is expensive — we’ll happily borrow and add any and all data from other concepts that are relevant to answering questions about the mart’s core entity. Building the same data in multiple places, as we do with `orders` in our `customers` mart example below, is more efficient in this paradigm than repeatedly rejoining these concepts (this is a basic definition of denormalization in this context). Let’s take a look at how we approach this first layer intended expressly for exposure to end users.
### Marts: Files and folders[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/4-marts?version=1.12#marts-files-and-folders "Direct link to Marts: Files and folders")
The last layer of our core transformations is below, providing models for both `finance` and `marketing` departments.
```
models/marts├── finance│   ├── _finance__models.yml│   ├── orders.sql│   └── payments.sql└── marketing    ├── _marketing__models.yml    └── customers.sql
```

✅ **Group by department or area of concern.** If you have fewer than 10 or so marts you may not have much need for subfolders, so as with the intermediate layer, don’t over-optimize too early. If you do find yourself needing to insert more structure and grouping though, use useful business concepts here. In our marts layer, we’re no longer worried about source-conformed data, so grouping by departments (marketing, finance, etc.) is the most common structure at this stage.
✅ **Name by entity.** Use plain English to name the file based on the concept that forms the grain of the mart’s `customers`, `orders`. Marts that don't include any time-based rollups (pure marts) should not have a time dimension (`orders_per_day`) here, typically best captured via metrics.
❌ **Build the same concept differently for different teams.** `finance_orders` and `marketing_orders` is typically considered an anti-pattern. There are, as always, exceptions — a common pattern we see is that, finance may have specific needs, for example reporting revenue to the government in a way that diverges from how the company as a whole measures revenue day-to-day. Just make sure that these are clearly designed and understandable as _separate_ concepts, not departmental views on the same concept: `tax_revenue` and `revenue` not `finance_revenue` and `marketing_revenue`.
### Marts: Models[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/4-marts?version=1.12#marts-models "Direct link to Marts: Models")
Finally we’ll take a look at the best practices for models within the marts directory by examining two of our marts models. These are the business-conformed — that is, crafted to our vision and needs — entities we’ve been bringing these transformed components together to create.
```
-- orders.sqlorders as(select*from {{ ref('stg_jaffle_shop__orders')}}order_payments as(select*from {{ ref('int_payments_pivoted_to_orders') }}orders_and_order_payments_joined as(select        orders.order_id,        orders.customer_id,        orders.order_date,coalesce(order_payments.total_amount,0)as amount,coalesce(order_payments.gift_card_amount,0)as gift_card_amountfrom ordersleftjoin order_payments on orders.order_id = order_payments.order_idselect*from orders_and_order_payments_joined
```

```
-- customers.sqlcustomers as(select*from {{ ref('stg_jaffle_shop__customers')}}orders as(select*from {{ ref('orders')}}customer_orders as(select        customer_id,min(order_date)as first_order_date,max(order_date)as most_recent_order_date,count(order_id)as number_of_orders,sum(amount)as lifetime_valuefrom ordersgroupby1customers_and_customer_orders_joined as(select        customers.customer_id,        customers.first_name,        customers.last_name,        customer_orders.first_order_date,        customer_orders.most_recent_order_date,coalesce(customer_orders.number_of_orders,0)as number_of_orders,        customer_orders.lifetime_valuefrom customersleftjoin customer_orders on customers.customer_id = customer_orders.customer_idselect*from customers_and_customer_orders_joined
```

  * ✅ **Materialized as tables or incremental models.** Once we reach the marts layer, it’s time to start building not just our logic into the warehouse, but the data itself. This gives end users much faster performance for these later models that are actually designed for their use, and saves us costs recomputing these entire chains of models every time somebody refreshes a dashboard or runs a regression in python. A good general rule of thumb regarding materialization is to always start with a view (as it takes up essentially no storage and always gives you up-to-date results), once that view takes too long to practically _query_ , build it into a table, and finally once that table takes too long to _build_ and is slowing down your runs, [configure it as an incremental model](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-models). As always, start simple and only add complexity as necessary. The models with the most data and compute-intensive transformations should absolutely take advantage of dbt’s excellent incremental materialization options, but rushing to make all your marts models incremental by default will introduce superfluous difficulty. We recommend reading this [classic post from Tristan on the limits of incremental modeling](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/on-the-limits-of-incrementality/303).
  * ✅ **Wide and denormalized.** Unlike old school warehousing, in the modern data stack storage is cheap and it’s compute that is expensive and must be prioritized as such, packing these into very wide denormalized concepts that can provide everything somebody needs about a concept as a goal.
  * ❌ **Too many joins in one mart.** One good rule of thumb when building dbt transformations is to avoid bringing together too many concepts in a single mart. What constitutes ‘too many’ can vary. If you need to bring 8 staging models together with nothing but simple joins, that might be fine. Conversely, if you have 4 concepts you’re weaving together with some complex and computationally heavy window functions, that could be too much. You need to weigh the number of models you’re joining against the complexity of the logic within the mart, and if it’s too much to read through and build a clear mental model of then look to modularize. While this isn’t a hard rule, if you’re bringing together more than 4 or 5 concepts to create your mart, you may benefit from adding some intermediate models for added clarity. Two intermediate models that bring together three concepts each, and a mart that brings together those two intermediate models, will typically result in a much more readable chain of logic than a single mart with six joins.
  * ✅ **Build on separate marts thoughtfully.** While we strive to preserve a narrowing DAG up to the marts layer, once here things may start to get a little less strict. A common example is passing information between marts at different grains, as we saw above, where we bring our `orders` mart into our `customers` marts to aggregate critical order data into a `customer` grain. Now that we’re really ‘spending’ compute and storage by actually building the data in our outputs, it’s sensible to leverage previously built resources to speed up and save costs on outputs that require similar data, versus recomputing the same views and CTEs from scratch. The right approach here is heavily dependent on your unique DAG, models, and goals — it’s just important to note that using a mart in building another, later mart is okay, but requires careful consideration to avoid wasted resources or circular dependencies.


The most important aspect of marts is that they contain all of the useful data about a _particular entity_ at a granular level. That doesn’t mean we don’t bring in lots of other entities and concepts, like tons of `user` data into our `orders` mart, we do! It just means that individual `orders` remain the core grain of our table. If we start grouping `users` and `orders` along a [date spine](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils#date_spine-source), into something like `user_orders_per_day`, we’re moving past marts into _metrics_.
### Marts: Other considerations[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/4-marts?version=1.12#marts-other-considerations "Direct link to Marts: Other considerations")
  * **Troubleshoot via tables.** While stacking views and ephemeral models up until our marts — only building data into the warehouse at the end of a chain when we have the models we really want end users to work with — is ideal in production, it can present some difficulties in development. Particularly, certain errors may seem to be surfacing in our later models that actually stem from much earlier dependencies in our model chain (ancestor models in our DAG that are built before the model throws the errors). If you’re having trouble pinning down where or what a database error is telling you, it can be helpful to temporarily build a specific chain of models as tables so that the warehouse will throw the error where it’s actually occurring.


### The dbt Semantic Layer and marts[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/4-marts?version=1.12#the-dbt-semantic-layer-and-marts "Direct link to The dbt Semantic Layer and marts")
Our structural recommendations are impacted quite a bit by whether or not you’re using the Semantic Layer. If you're using the Semantic Layer, we recommend a more normalized approach to your marts. If you're not using the Semantic Layer, we recommend a more denormalized approach that has become typical in dbt projects. For the full list of recommendations on structure, naming, and organization in the Semantic Layer, check out the [How we build our metrics](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-1-intro) guide, particularly the [Refactoring an existing rollup](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-8-refactor-a-rollup) section.

On this page
## Basics[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/2-how-we-style-our-sql?version=1.12#basics "Direct link to Basics")
  * ☁️ Use [SQLFluff](https://sqlfluff.com/) to maintain these style rules automatically.
    * Customize `.sqlfluff` configuration files to your needs.
    * Refer to our [SQLFluff config file](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle-shop-template/blob/main/.sqlfluff) for the rules we use in our own projects.
    * Exclude files and directories by using a standard `.sqlfluffignore` file. Learn more about the syntax in the [.sqlfluffignore syntax docs](https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/configuration/index.html).
      * Excluding unnecessary folders and files (such as `target/`, `dbt_packages/`, and `macros/`) can speed up linting, improve run times, and help you avoid irrelevant logs.
  * 👻 Use Jinja comments (`{# #}`) for comments that should not be included in the compiled SQL.
  * ⏭️ Use trailing commas.
  * 4️⃣ Indents should be four spaces.
  * 📏 Lines of SQL should be no longer than 80 characters.
  * ⬇️ Field names, keywords, and function names should all be lowercase.
  * 🫧 The `as` keyword should be used explicitly when aliasing a field or table.


☁️ dbt users can use the built-in [SQLFluff Studio IDE integration](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/studio-ide/lint-format) to automatically lint and format their SQL. The default style sheet is based on dbt Labs style as outlined in this guide, but you can customize this to fit your needs. No need to setup any external tools, just hit `Lint`! Also, the more opinionated [sqlfmt](http://sqlfmt.com/) formatter is also available if you prefer that style.
## Fields, aggregations, and grouping[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/2-how-we-style-our-sql?version=1.12#fields-aggregations-and-grouping "Direct link to Fields, aggregations, and grouping")
  * 🔙 Fields should be stated before aggregates and window functions.
  * 🤏🏻 Aggregations should be executed as early as possible (on the smallest data set possible) before joining to another table to improve performance.
  * 🔢 Ordering and grouping by a number (eg. group by 1, 2) is preferred over listing the column names (see [this classic rant](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/write-better-sql-a-defense-of-group-by-1) for why). Note that if you are grouping by more than a few columns, it may be worth revisiting your model design.


## Joins[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/2-how-we-style-our-sql?version=1.12#joins "Direct link to Joins")
  * 👭🏻 Prefer `union all` to `union` unless you explicitly want to remove duplicates.
  * 👭🏻 If joining two or more tables, _always_ prefix your column names with the table name. If only selecting from one table, prefixes are not needed.
  * 👭🏻 Be explicit about your join type (i.e. write `inner join` instead of `join`).
  * 🥸 Avoid table aliases in join conditions (especially initialisms) — it's harder to understand what the table called "c" is as compared to "customers".
  * ➡️ Always move left to right to make joins easy to reason about - `right joins` often indicate that you should change which table you select `from` and which one you `join` to.


## 'Import' CTEs[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/2-how-we-style-our-sql?version=1.12#import-ctes "Direct link to 'Import' CTEs")
  * 🔝 All `{{ ref('...') }}` statements should be placed in CTEs at the top of the file.
  * 📦 'Import' CTEs should be named after the table they are referencing.
  * 🤏🏻 Limit the data scanned by CTEs as much as possible. Where possible, only select the columns you're actually using and use `where` clauses to filter out unneeded data.
  * For example:


```
orders as(select        order_id,        customer_id,        order_total,        order_datefrom {{ ref('orders') }}where order_date >='2020-01-01'
```

## 'Functional' CTEs[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/2-how-we-style-our-sql?version=1.12#functional-ctes "Direct link to 'Functional' CTEs")
  * ☝🏻 Where performance permits, CTEs should perform a single, logical unit of work.
  * 📖 CTE names should be as verbose as needed to convey what they do e.g. `events_joined_to_users` instead of `user_events` (this could be a good model name, but does not describe a specific function or transformation).
  * 🌉 CTEs that are duplicated across models should be pulled out into their own intermediate models. Look out for chunks of repeated logic that should be refactored into their own model.
  * 🔚 The last line of a model should be a `select *` from your final output CTE. This makes it easy to materialize and audit the output from different steps in the model as you're developing it. You just change the CTE referenced in the `select` statement to see the output from that step.


## Model configuration[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/2-how-we-style-our-sql?version=1.12#model-configuration "Direct link to Model configuration")
  * 📝 Model-specific attributes (like sort/dist keys) should be specified in the model.
  * 📂 If a particular configuration applies to all models in a directory, it should be specified in the `dbt_project.yml` file.
  * 👓 In-model configurations should be specified like this for maximum readability:


```
    config(      materialized ='table',      sort ='id',      dist ='id'
```

## Example SQL[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-style/2-how-we-style-our-sql?version=1.12#example-sql "Direct link to Example SQL")
```
events as({# CTE comments go here #}filtered_events as(select*from filtered_events

On this page
This section covers three core incremental patterns for achieving near real-time data freshness:
  1. [Incremental MERGE from append-only tables](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#incremental-merge-from-append-only-tables)
  2. [CDC with Snowflake Streams](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#cdc-with-snowflake-streams)
  3. [Microbatch for large time-series tables](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#microbatch-for-large-time-series-tables)


Some patterns on this guide uses Snowflake-specific features. Other warehouses have similar features with different implementations. Refer to the [additional resources](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/3-warehouse-native-features#resources-by-warehouse) section for adapter-specific documentation.
## Pattern 1: Incremental MERGE from append-only tables[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#incremental-merge-from-append-only-tables "Direct link to Pattern 1: Incremental MERGE from append-only tables")
This pattern uses the `merge` incremental strategy to upsert (insert + update) new and updated rows into a target table. Most data platforms support the `merge` strategy. See the [supported incremental strategies by adapter](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-strategy#supported-incremental-strategies-by-adapter) for details.
"Append-only tables" refers to a data pattern where source data continuously receives new rows without updates or deletes.
### When to use the merge strategy[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#when-to-use-the-merge-strategy "Direct link to When to use the merge strategy")
Use this pattern when raw events continuously land into a staging table and you want a near real-time fact table updated every few minutes.
### Example model[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#example-model "Direct link to Example model")
In this example, assume you have raw events continuously landing into `raw.events` (using Snowpipe, Databricks Auto Loader, Kafka, or a similar ingestion mechanism) and you're looking for a near real‑time fact table `analytics.fct_events` updated every few minutes.
Configure the SQL model with the following settings:
  * Use the `incremental` filter to only scan rows newer than the latest timestamp already in the target.
  * Use `incremental_strategy='merge'` with `unique_key=event_id` to give you idempotent upserts (inserts + updates).
  * Cluster by date using `cluster_by=['event_date']` helps with query pruning during `MERGE` operations (syntax varies by warehouse).
  * Run the model every few minutes to achieve a freshness service level agreement (SLA) measured in minutes, depending on ingestion and job scheduling.


The following example uses Snowflake SQL syntax (`::` type casting, `timestamp_ntz`, `cluster_by` config). Make sure you adapt the SQL and clustering syntax for your warehouse.
models/fct_events.sql
```
{{ config(    materialized ='incremental',    incremental_strategy ='merge',-- default on Snowflake    unique_key ='event_id',    cluster_by =['event_date']-- helps MERGE performance (syntax varies by warehouse)with source_events as(select        event_id,        event_ts::timestamp_ntz       as event_ts,-- Snowflake syntax for type casting        to_date(event_ts)as event_date,        user_id,        event_type,        payloadfrom {{ source('raw','events') }}%if is_incremental()%} -- Only pull new/changed rows since last successful loadwhere event_ts (selectmax(event_ts)from {{ this }})% endif %}deduped as(-- optional: if the raw feed can produce duplicatesselect*select            row_number()over(partitionby event_idorderby event_ts desc)as _rnfrom source_eventswhere _rn =1select    event_id,    event_ts,    event_date,    user_id,    event_type,    payloadfrom deduped;
```

To ensure the best results:
  * Use clustering keys wisely for better `MERGE` performance.
  * Monitor `MERGE` performance as your table grows.
  * Consider adding a lookback window (for example, `event_ts > max(event_ts) - interval '1 hour'`) to handle late-arriving data.


## Pattern 2: CDC with Snowflake Streams[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#cdc-with-snowflake-streams "Direct link to Pattern 2: CDC with Snowflake Streams")
This pattern leverages Snowflake's native Change Data Capture (CDC) capabilities through [Streams](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/streams-intro), a Snowflake-specific feature which tracks changes (inserts, updates, deletes) to source tables.
### When to use CDC[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#when-to-use-cdc "Direct link to When to use CDC")
Use CDC when:
  * You have source tables that receive frequent updates (not just appends).
  * You need to capture both new records and changes to existing records.
  * You want to avoid full table scans on large source tables.


### Setup[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#setup "Direct link to Setup")
To use this pattern, set up the stream in your data warehouse and then create a model to consume the stream.
  1. Create the stream (one-time, outside dbt):


```
createorreplace stream RAW.EVENTS_STREAMontable RAW.EVENTS;
```

  1. Create a model consuming the stream:


models/fct_events_cdc.sql
```
{{ config(    materialized ='incremental',    incremental_strategy ='merge',    unique_key ='event_id',    cluster_by =['event_date'],    snowflake_warehouse ='TRANSFORM_WH'with changes as(select        event_id,        event_ts::timestamp_ntz        as event_ts,        to_date(event_ts)as event_date,        user_id,        event_type,        payload,        metadata$actionas change_type-- points at the STREAM, not the tablefrom {{ source('raw','events_stream') }}filtered as(select*from changeswhere change_type in('INSERT','UPDATE')-- If you want to physically delete, you could also handle 'DELETE' hereselect    event_id,    event_ts,    event_date,    user_id,    event_type,    payloadfrom filtered;
```

### Pattern distinctions[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#pattern-distinctions "Direct link to Pattern distinctions")
There are some key differences from [pattern 1](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#incremental-merge-from-append-only-tables):
  * Streams only return changed rows, so you don’t need an `is_incremental()` time filter. Each run processes only the changes available at the moment.
  * Run the model every few minutes to pull new changes and merge them into `fct_events`.
  * This gives you a CDC-style pipeline. Snowflake Streams captures changes, and dbt handles transformations, tests, and lineage.


## Pattern 3: Microbatch for large time-series tables[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#microbatch-for-large-time-series-tables "Direct link to Pattern 3: Microbatch for large time-series tables")
For large `fact` tables where backfills or long lookback windows are challenging, use `incremental_strategy='microbatch'` (available in dbt Core v1.9 or higher and Latest release track in dbt platform). Refer to [incremental microbatch](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-microbatch) for more details. Note that Microsoft Fabric doesn't support microbatch yet. See [incremental strategy by adapter](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-strategy#supported-incremental-strategies-by-adapter) for more details.
Every upstream model feeding this microbatch model must also be configured with `event_time` so dbt can push time-filters upstream. Otherwise, each batch could re-scan full upstream tables.
### When to use microbatch[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#when-to-use-microbatch "Direct link to When to use microbatch")
  * You have massive time-series tables (billions of rows).
  * Backfills are slow and risky with traditional incremental approaches.
  * You need to reprocess data in manageable chunks.
  * Late-arriving data is common.


### Model configuration[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#model-configuration "Direct link to Model configuration")
Let's say you have a `fact_events` table with a `event_ts` column and you want to process it in hourly chunks. You can configure the model as follows:
models/fct_events_microbatch.sql
```
{{ config(    materialized        ='incremental',    incremental_strategy='microbatch',    event_time          ='event_ts',-- time column in this model    batch_size          ='hour',-- process in hourly chunks    lookback            =1,-- reprocess 1 prior batch to catch late data    unique_key          ='event_id',    cluster_by          =['event_date'],    full_refresh        =falseselect    event_id,    event_ts::timestamp_ntz   as event_ts,    to_date(event_ts)as event_date,    user_id,    event_type,    payloadfrom {{ ref('stg_events') }};
```

### Key behavior[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#key-behavior "Direct link to Key behavior")
  * Use microbatch for massive fact tables (clickstream, IoT, point-of-sale) with multi-year history.
  * No `is_incremental() block` needed — dbt automatically generates the appropriate `WHERE event_ts BETWEEN..` predicates per batch based on `event_time`, `batch_size`, `begin`, `lookback`, and so on.
  * Each run processes multiple smaller queries (one per batch), making larger backfills safer and easier to retry.
  * The `lookback` parameter automatically handles late-arriving data by reprocessing recent batches.
  * Schedule jobs based on your SLA.


## Choosing the right incremental pattern[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#choosing-the-right-incremental-pattern "Direct link to Choosing the right incremental pattern")
The pattern you select will depend on your use case. Start with [pattern 1](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#incremental-merge-from-append-only-tables) (`MERGE`), since it's appropriate for most use cases. Upgrade to [pattern 2](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#cdc-with-snowflake-streams) (use your data warehouse's native CDC features) when you need efficient CDC. Reach for [pattern 3](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/2-incremental-patterns?version=1.12#microbatch-for-large-time-series-tables) (Microbatch) when dealing with massive scale.
Use the following table to help you choose the right pattern:
Pattern | Best for | Key benefit
---|---|---
`merge` from append-only | Most standard use cases | Simple, widely understood
CDC with Streams | Tables with frequent updates | Efficient change capture
Microbatch | Massive time-series tables | Safe backfills, late-data handling
Pattern |  Best for |  Key benefit
---|---|---
`merge` from append-only | Most standard use cases | Simple, widely understood
CDC with Streams | Tables with frequent updates | Efficient change capture
Microbatch | Massive time-series tables | Safe backfills, late-data handling

### Project structure review[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/5-the-rest-of-the-project?version=1.12#project-structure-review "Direct link to Project structure review")
So far we’ve focused on the `models` folder, the primary directory of our dbt project. Next, we’ll zoom out and look at how the rest of our project files and folders fit in with this structure, starting with how we approach YAML configuration files.
```
models├── intermediate│   └── finance│       ├── _int_finance__models.yml│       └── int_payments_pivoted_to_orders.sql├── marts│   ├── finance│   │   ├── _finance__models.yml│   │   ├── orders.sql│   │   └── payments.sql│   └── marketing│       ├── _marketing__models.yml│       └── customers.sql├── staging│   ├── jaffle_shop│   │   ├── _jaffle_shop__docs.md│   │   ├── _jaffle_shop__models.yml│   │   ├── _jaffle_shop__sources.yml│   │   ├── base│   │   │   ├── base_jaffle_shop__customers.sql│   │   │   └── base_jaffle_shop__deleted_customers.sql│   │   ├── stg_jaffle_shop__customers.sql│   │   └── stg_jaffle_shop__orders.sql│   └── stripe│       ├── _stripe__models.yml│       ├── _stripe__sources.yml│       └── stg_stripe__payments.sql└── utilities    └── all_dates.sql

### YAML in-depth[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/5-the-rest-of-the-project?version=1.12#yaml-in-depth "Direct link to YAML in-depth")
When structuring your YAML configuration files in a dbt project, you want to balance centralization and file size to make specific configs as easy to find as possible. It’s important to note that while the top-level YAML files (`dbt_project.yml`, `packages.yml`) need to be specifically named and in specific locations, the files containing your `sources` and `models` dictionaries can be named, located, and organized however you want. It’s the internal contents that matter here. As such, we’ll lay out our primary recommendation, as well as the pros and cons of a popular alternative. Like many other aspects of structuring your dbt project, what’s most important here is consistency, clear intention, and thorough documentation on how and why you do what you do.
  * ✅ **Config per folder.** As in the example above, create a `_[directory]__models.yml` per directory in your models folder that configures all the models in that directory. for staging folders, also include a `_[directory]__sources.yml` per directory.
    * The leading underscore ensures your YAML files will be sorted to the top of every folder to make them easy to separate from your models.
    * YAML files don’t need unique names in the way that SQL model files do, but including the directory (instead of simply `_sources.yml` in each folder), means you can fuzzy find the right file more quickly.
    * We’ve recommended several different naming conventions over the years, most recently calling these `schema.yml` files. We’ve simplified to recommend that these simply be labelled based on the YAML dictionary that they contain.
    * If you utilize [doc blocks](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/documentation#using-docs-blocks) in your project, we recommend following the same pattern, and creating a `_[directory]__docs.md` markdown file per directory containing all your doc blocks for that folder of models.
  * ❌ **Config per project.** Some people put _all_ of their source and model YAML into one file. While you can technically do this, and while it certainly simplifies knowing what file the config you’re looking for will be in (as there is only one file), it makes it much harder to find specific configurations within that file. We recommend balancing those two concerns.
  * ⚠️ **Config per model.** On the other end of the spectrum, some people prefer to create one YAML file per model. This presents less of an issue than a single monolith file, as you can quickly search for files, know exactly where specific configurations exist, spot models without configs (and thus without tests) by looking at the file tree, and various other advantages. In our opinion, the extra files, tabs, and windows this requires creating, copying from, pasting to, closing, opening, and managing creates a somewhat slower development experience that outweighs the benefits. Defining config per directory is the most balanced approach for most projects, but if you have compelling reasons to use config per model, there are definitely some great projects that follow this paradigm.
  * ✅ **Cascade configs.** Leverage your `dbt_project.yml` to set default configurations at the directory level. Use the well-organized folder structure we’ve created thus far to define the baseline schemas and materializations, and use dbt’s cascading scope priority to define variations to this. For example, as below, define your marts to be materialized as tables by default, define separate schemas for our separate subfolders, and any models that need to use incremental materialization can be defined at the model level.


```
-- dbt_project.ymlmodels:jaffle_shop:staging:+materialized: viewintermediate:+materialized: ephemeralmarts:+materialized: tablefinance:+schema: financemarketing:+schema: marketing
```

One of the many benefits this consistent approach to project structure confers to us is this ability to cascade default behavior. Carefully organizing our folders and defining configuration at that level whenever possible frees us from configuring things like schema and materialization in every single model (not very DRY!) — we only need to configure exceptions to our general rules. Tagging is another area this principle comes into play. Many people new to dbt will rely on tags rather than a rigorous folder structure, and quickly find themselves in a place where every model _requires_ a tag. This creates unnecessary complexity. We want to lean on our folders as our primary selectors and grouping mechanism, and use tags to define groups that are _exceptions._ A folder-based selection like **`dbt build --select marts.marketing` is much simpler than trying to tag every marketing-related model, hoping all developers remember to add that tag for new models, and using `dbt build --select tag:marketing`.
#### Defining groups[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/5-the-rest-of-the-project?version=1.12#defining-groups "Direct link to Defining groups")
A group is a collection of nodes within a dbt DAG. Groups enable intentional collaboration within and across teams by restricting [access to private](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/access) models.
Groups are defined in `.yml` files, nested under a `groups:` key. You can add the `meta` config to add more information about the group.
models/marts/finance/finance.yml
```
groups:-name: financeowner:# 'name' or 'email' is required; additional properties will no longer be allowed in a future releaseemail: finance@jaffleshop.comconfig:meta:# optionaldata_owner: Finance team
```

For more information about using groups, see [Add groups to your DAG](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/groups).
### How we use the other folders[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/5-the-rest-of-the-project?version=1.12#how-we-use-the-other-folders "Direct link to How we use the other folders")
```

```

We’ve focused heavily thus far on the primary area of action in our dbt project, the `models` folder. As you’ve probably observed though, there are several other folders in our project. While these are, by design, very flexible to your needs, we’ll discuss the most common use cases for these other folders to help get you started.
  * ✅ `seeds` for lookup tables. The most common use case for seeds is loading lookup tables that are helpful for modeling but don’t exist in any source systems — think mapping zip codes to states, or UTM parameters to marketing campaigns. In this example project we have a small seed that maps our employees to their `customer_id`s, so that we can handle their purchases with special logic.
  * ❌ `seeds` for loading source data. Do not use seeds to load data from a source system into your warehouse. If it exists in a system you have access to, you should be loading it with a proper EL tool into the raw data area of your warehouse. dbt is designed to operate on data in the warehouse, not as a data-loading tool.
  * ✅ `analyses` for storing auditing queries. The `analyses` folder lets you store any queries you want to use Jinja with and version control, but not build into models in your warehouse. There are limitless possibilities here, but the most common use case when we set up projects at dbt Labs is to keep queries that leverage the [audit helper](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-audit-helper) package. This package is incredibly useful for finding discrepancies in output when migrating logic from another system into dbt.
  * ✅ `tests` for testing multiple specific tables simultaneously. As dbt tests have evolved, writing singular tests has become less and less necessary. It's extremely useful for work-shopping test logic, but more often than not you'll find yourself either migrating that logic into your own custom generic tests or discovering a pre-built test that meets your needs from the ever-expanding universe of dbt packages (between the extra tests in [`dbt-utils`](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils) and [`dbt-expectations`](https://github.com/calogica/dbt-expectations) almost any situation is covered). One area where singular tests still shine though is flexibly testing things that require a variety of specific models. If you're familiar with the difference between [unit tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) [and](https://www.testim.io/blog/unit-test-vs-integration-test/) [integration](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/what-is-integration-testing/) [tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing) in software engineering, you can think of generic and singular tests in a similar way. If you need to test the results of how several specific models interact or relate to each other, a singular test will likely be the quickest way to nail down your logic.
  * ✅ `snapshots` for creating [Type 2 slowly changing dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowly_changing_dimension#Type_2:_add_new_row) records from [Type 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowly_changing_dimension#Type_1:_overwrite) (destructively updated) source data. This is [covered thoroughly in the dbt Docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/snapshots), unlike these other folders has a more defined purpose, and is out-of-scope for this guide, but mentioned for completion.
  * ✅ `macros` for DRY-ing up transformations you find yourself doing repeatedly. Like snapshots, a full dive into macros is out-of-scope for this guide and well [covered elsewhere](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/jinja-macros), but one important structure-related recommendation is to [write documentation for your macros](https://docs.getdbt.com/faqs/Docs/documenting-macros). We recommend creating a `_macros.yml` and documenting the purpose and arguments for your macros once they’re ready for use.


### Project splitting[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/5-the-rest-of-the-project?version=1.12#project-splitting "Direct link to Project splitting")
One important, growing consideration in the analytics engineering ecosystem is how and when to split a codebase into multiple dbt projects. Currently, our advice for most teams, especially those just starting, is fairly simple: in most cases, we recommend doing so with [Mesh](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-1-intro)! Mesh allows organizations to handle complexity by connecting several dbt projects rather than relying on one big, monolithic project. This approach is designed to speed up development while maintaining governance.
As breaking up monolithic dbt projects into smaller, connected projects, potentially within a modern mono repo becomes easier, the scenarios we currently advise against may soon become feasible. So watch this space!
  * ✅ **Business groups or departments.** Conceptual separations within the project are the primary reason to split up your project. This allows your business domains to own their own data products and still collaborate using Mesh. For more information about Mesh, please refer to our [Mesh FAQs](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-5-faqs).
  * ✅ **Data governance.** Structural, organizational needs — such as data governance and security — are one of the few worthwhile reasons to split up a project. If, for instance, you work at a healthcare company with only a small team cleared to access raw data with PII in it, you may need to split out your staging models into their own projects to preserve those policies. In that case, you would import your staging project into the project that builds on those staging models as a [private package](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/packages#private-packages).
  * ✅ **Project size.** At a certain point, your project may grow to have simply too many models to present a viable development experience. If you have 1000s of models, it absolutely makes sense to find a way to split up your project.
  * ❌ **ML vs Reporting use cases.** Similarly to the point above, splitting a project up based on different use cases, particularly more standard BI versus ML features, is a common idea. We tend to discourage it for the time being. As with the previous point, a foundational goal of implementing dbt is to create a single source of truth in your organization. The features you’re providing to your data science teams should be coming from the same marts and metrics that serve reports on executive dashboards.


## Final considerations[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/5-the-rest-of-the-project?version=1.12#final-considerations "Direct link to Final considerations")
Overall, consistency is more important than any of these specific conventions. As your project grows and your experience with dbt deepens, you will undoubtedly find aspects of the above structure you want to change. While we recommend this approach for the majority of projects, every organization is unique! The only dogmatic advice we’ll put forward here is that when you find aspects of the above structure you wish to change, think intently about your reasoning and document for your team _how_ and _why_ you are deviating from these conventions. To that end, we highly encourage you to fork this guide and add it to your project’s README, wiki, or docs so you can quickly create and customize those artifacts.
Finally, we emphasize that this guide is a living document! It will certainly change and grow as dbt and dbt Labs evolve. We invite you to join in — discuss, comment, and contribute regarding suggested changes or new elements to cover.

Once we’ve got our atoms ready to work with, we’ll set about bringing them together into more intricate, connected molecular shapes. The intermediate layer is where these molecules live, creating varied forms with specific purposes on the way towards the more complex proteins and cells we’ll use to breathe life into our data products.
### Intermediate: Files and folders[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/3-intermediate?version=1.12#intermediate-files-and-folders "Direct link to Intermediate: Files and folders")
Let’s take a look at the intermediate layer of our project to understand the purpose of this stage more concretely.
```
models/intermediate└── finance    ├── _int_finance__models.yml    └── int_payments_pivoted_to_orders.sql
```

  * **Folders**
    * ✅ **Subdirectories based on business groupings.** Much like the staging layer, we’ll house this layer of models inside their own `intermediate` subfolder. Unlike the staging layer, here we shift towards being business-conformed, splitting our models up into subdirectories not by their source system, but by their area of business concern.
  * **File names**
    * `✅ int_[entity]s_[verb]s.sql` - the variety of transformations that can happen inside of the intermediate layer makes it harder to dictate strictly how to name them. The best guiding principle is to think about _verbs_ (e.g. `pivoted`, `aggregated_to_user`, `joined`, `fanned_out_by_quantity`, `funnel_created`, etc.) in the intermediate layer. In our example project, we use an intermediate model to pivot payments out to the order grain, so we name our model `int_payments_pivoted_to_orders`. It’s easy for anybody to quickly understand what’s happening in that model, even if they don’t know [SQL](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/). That clarity is worth the long file name. It’s important to note that we’ve dropped the double underscores at this layer. In moving towards business-conformed concepts, we no longer need to separate a system and an entity and simply reference the unified entity if possible. In cases where you need intermediate models to operate at the source system level (e.g. `int_shopify__orders_summed`, `int_core__orders_summed` which you would later union), you’d preserve the double underscores. Some people like to separate the entity and verbs with double underscores as well. That’s a matter of preference, but in our experience, there is often an intrinsic connection between entities and verbs in this layer that make that difficult to maintain.


The example project is very simple for illustrative purposes. This level of division in our post-staging layers is probably unnecessary when dealing with these few models. Remember, our goal is a _single_ _source of truth._ We don’t want finance and marketing operating on separate `orders` models, we want to use our dbt project as a means to bring those definitions together! As such, don’t split and optimize too early. If you have less than 10 marts models and aren’t having problems developing and using them, feel free to forego subdirectories completely (except in the staging layer, where you should always implement them as you add new source systems to your project) until the project has grown to really need them. Using dbt is always about bringing simplicity to complexity.
### Intermediate: Models[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/3-intermediate?version=1.12#intermediate-models "Direct link to Intermediate: Models")
Below is the lone intermediate model from our small example project. This represents an excellent use case per our principles above, serving a clear single purpose: grouping and pivoting a staging model to different grain. It utilizes a bit of Jinja to make the model DRY-er (striving to be DRY applies to the code we write inside a single model in addition to transformations across the codebase), but don’t be intimidated if you’re not quite comfortable with [Jinja](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/jinja-macros) yet. Looking at the name of the CTE`pivot_and_aggregate_payments_to_order_grain` we get a very clear idea of what’s happening inside this block. By descriptively labeling the transformations happening inside our CTEs within our model, just as we do with our files and folders, even a stakeholder who doesn’t know SQL would be able to grasp the purpose of this section, if not the code. As you begin to write more complex transformations moving out of the staging layer, keep this idea in mind. In the same way our models connect into a DAG and tell the story of our transformations on a macro scale, CTEs can do this on a smaller scale inside our model files.
```
-- int_payments_pivoted_to_orders.sql{%-set payment_methods =['bank_transfer','credit_card','coupon','gift_card']-%}payments as(select*from {{ ref('stg_stripe__payments') }}pivot_and_aggregate_payments_to_order_grain as(select      order_id,%for payment_method in payment_methods -%}when payment_method ='{{ payment_method }}'andstatus='success'then amount)as {{ payment_method }}_amount,%- endfor %}sum(casewhenstatus='success'then amount end)as total_amountfrom paymentsgroupby1select*from pivot_and_aggregate_payments_to_order_grain
```

  * ❌ **Exposed to end users.** Intermediate models should generally not be exposed in the main production schema. They are not intended for output to final targets like dashboards or applications, so it’s best to keep them separated from models that are so you can more easily control data governance and discoverability.
  * ✅ **Materialized ephemerally.** Considering the above, one popular option is to default to intermediate models being materialized [ephemerally](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/materializations#ephemeral). This is generally the best place to start for simplicity. It will keep unnecessary models out of your warehouse with minimum configuration. Keep in mind though that the simplicity of ephemerals does translate a bit more difficulty in troubleshooting, as they’re interpolated into the models that `ref` them, rather than existing on their own in a way that you can view the output of.
  * ✅ **Materialized as views in a custom schema with special permissions.** A more robust option is to materialize your intermediate models as views in a specific [custom schema](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/custom-schemas), outside of your main production schema. This gives you added insight into development and easier troubleshooting as the number and complexity of your models grows, while remaining easy to implement and taking up negligible space.


There are three interfaces to the organizational knowledge graph we’re encoding into dbt and folder structure of our codebase, and the output into the warehouse. As such, it’s really important that we consider that output intentionally! Think of the schemas, tables, and views we’re creating in the warehouse as _part of the UX,_ in addition to the dashboards, ML, apps, and other use cases you may be targeting for the data. Ensuring that our output is named and grouped well, and that models not intended for broad use are either not materialized or built into special areas with specific permissions is crucial to achieving this.
  * Intermediate models’ purposes, as these serve to break up complexity from our marts models, can take as many forms as [data transformation](https://www.getdbt.com/analytics-engineering/transformation/) might require. Some of the most common use cases of intermediate models include:
    * ✅ **Structural simplification.** Bringing together a reasonable number (typically 4 to 6) of entities or concepts (staging models, or perhaps other intermediate models) that will be joined with another similarly purposed intermediate model to generate a mart — rather than have 10 joins in our mart, we can join two intermediate models that each house a piece of the complexity, giving us increased readability, flexibility, testing surface area, and insight into our components.
    * ✅ **Re-graining.** Intermediate models are often used to fan out or collapse models to the right composite grain — if we’re building a mart for `order_items` that requires us to fan out our `orders` based on the `quantity` column, creating a new single row for each item, this would be ideal to do in a specific intermediate model to maintain clarity in our mart and more easily view that our grain is correct before we mix it with other components.
    * ✅ **Isolating complex operations.** It’s helpful to move any particularly complex or difficult to understand pieces of logic into their own intermediate models. This not only makes them easier to refine and troubleshoot, but simplifies later models that can reference this concept in a more clearly readable way. For example, in the `quantity` fan out example above, we benefit by isolating this complex piece of logic so we can quickly debug and thoroughly test that transformation, and downstream models can reference `order_items` in a way that’s intuitively easy to grasp.


Until we get to the marts layer and start building our various outputs, we ideally want our DAG to look like an arrowhead pointed right. As we move from source-conformed to business-conformed, we’re also moving from numerous, narrow, isolated concepts to fewer, wider, joined concepts. We’re bringing our components together into wider, richer concepts, and that creates this shape in our DAG. This way when we get to the marts layer we have a robust set of components that can quickly and easily be put into any configuration to answer a variety of questions and serve specific needs. One rule of thumb to ensure you’re following this pattern on an individual model level is allowing multiple _inputs_ to a model, but **not** multiple _outputs_. Several arrows going _into_ our post-staging models is great and expected, several arrows coming _out_ is a red flag. There are absolutely situations where you need to break this rule, but it’s something to be aware of, careful about, and avoid when possible.

The staging layer is where our journey begins. This is the foundation of our project, where we bring all the individual components we're going to use to build our more complex and useful models into the project.
We'll use an analogy for working with dbt throughout this guide: thinking modularly in terms of atoms, molecules, and more complex outputs like proteins or cells (we apologize in advance to any chemists or biologists for our inevitable overstretching of this metaphor). Within that framework, if our source system data is a soup of raw energy and quarks, then you can think of the staging layer as condensing and refining this material into the individual atoms we’ll later build more intricate and useful structures with.
### Staging: Files and folders[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/2-staging?version=1.12#staging-files-and-folders "Direct link to Staging: Files and folders")
Let's zoom into the staging directory from our `models` file tree [in the overview](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview) and walk through what's going on here.
```
models/staging├── jaffle_shop│   ├── _jaffle_shop__docs.md│   ├── _jaffle_shop__models.yml│   ├── _jaffle_shop__sources.yml│   ├── base│   │   ├── base_jaffle_shop__customers.sql│   │   └── base_jaffle_shop__deleted_customers.sql│   ├── stg_jaffle_shop__customers.sql│   └── stg_jaffle_shop__orders.sql└── stripe    ├── _stripe__models.yml    ├── _stripe__sources.yml    └── stg_stripe__payments.sql
```

  * **Folders.** Folder structure is extremely important in dbt. Not only do we need a consistent structure to find our way around the codebase, as with any software project, but our folder structure is also one of the key interfaces for understanding the knowledge graph encoded in our project (alongside the DAG and the data output into our warehouse). It should reflect how the data flows, step-by-step, from a wide variety of source-conformed models into fewer, richer business-conformed models. Moreover, we can use our folder structure as a means of selection in dbt [selector syntax](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/syntax). For example, with the above structure, if we got fresh Stripe data loaded and wanted to run all the models that build on our Stripe data, we can easily run `dbt build --select staging.stripe+` and we’re all set for building more up-to-date reports on payments.
    * ✅ **Subdirectories based on the source system**. Our internal transactional database is one system, the data we get from Stripe's API is another, and lastly the events from our Snowplow instrumentation. We've found this to be the best grouping for most companies, as source systems tend to share similar loading methods and properties between tables, and this allows us to operate on those similar sets easily.
    * ❌ **Subdirectories based on loader.** Some people attempt to group by how the data is loaded (Fivetran, Stitch, custom syncs), but this is too broad to be useful on a project of any real size.
    * ❌ **Subdirectories based on business grouping.** Another approach we recommend against is splitting up by business groupings in the staging layer, and creating subdirectories like 'marketing', 'finance', etc. A key goal of any great dbt project should be establishing a single source of truth. By breaking things up too early, we open ourselves up to creating overlap and conflicting definitions (think marketing and financing having different fundamental tables for orders). We want everybody to be building with the same set of atoms, so in our experience, starting our transformations with our staging structure reflecting the source system structures is the best level of grouping for this step.
  * **File names.** Creating a consistent pattern of file naming is [crucial in dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/on-the-importance-of-naming). File names must be unique and correspond to the name of the model when selected and created in the warehouse. We recommend putting as much clear information into the file name as possible, including a prefix for the layer the model exists in, important grouping information, and specific information about the entity or transformation in the model.
    * ✅ `stg_[source]__[entity]s.sql` - the double underscore between source system and entity helps visually distinguish the separate parts in the case of a source name having multiple words. For instance, `google_analytics__campaigns` is always understandable, whereas to somebody unfamiliar `google_analytics_campaigns` could be `analytics_campaigns` from the `google` source system as easily as `campaigns` from the `google_analytics` source system. Think of it like an [oxford comma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_i1xk07o4g), the extra clarity is very much worth the extra punctuation.
    * ❌ `stg_[entity].sql` - might be specific enough at first, but will break down in time. Adding the source system into the file name aids in discoverability, and allows understanding where a component model came from even if you aren't looking at the file tree.
    * ✅ **Plural.** SQL, and particularly SQL in dbt, should read as much like prose as we can achieve. We want to lean into the broad clarity and declarative nature of SQL when possible. As such, unless there’s a single order in your `orders` table, plural is the correct way to describe what is in a table with multiple rows.


### Staging: Models[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/2-staging?version=1.12#staging-models "Direct link to Staging: Models")
Now that we’ve got a feel for how the files and folders fit together, let’s look inside one of these files and dig into what makes for a well-structured staging model.
Below, is an example of a standard staging model (from our `stg_stripe__payments` model) that illustrates the common patterns within the staging layer. We’ve organized our model into two CTEs[source macro](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/sources#selecting-from-a-source) and the other applying our transformations.
While our later layers of transformation will vary greatly from model to model, every one of our staging models will follow this exact same pattern. As such, we need to make sure the pattern we’ve established is rock solid and consistent.
```
-- stg_stripe__payments.sqlsource as(select*from {{ source('stripe','payment') }}renamed as(select-- idsas payment_id,        orderid as order_id,-- strings        paymentmethod as payment_method,when payment_method in('stripe','paypal','credit_card','gift_card')then'credit'else'cash'endas payment_type,status,-- numerics        amount as amount_cents,        amount /100.0as amount,-- booleanswhenstatus='successful'thentrueelsefalseendas is_completed_payment,-- dates        date_trunc('day', created)as created_date,-- timestamps        created::timestamp_ltz as created_atfrom sourceselect*from renamed
```

  * Based on the above, the most standard types of staging model transformations are:
    * ✅ **Renaming**
    * ✅ **Type casting**
    * ✅ **Basic computations** (e.g. cents to dollars)
    * ✅ **Categorizing** (using conditional logic to group values into buckets or booleans, such as in the `case when` statements above)
    * ❌ **Joins** — the goal of staging models is to clean and prepare individual source-conformed concepts for downstream usage. We're creating the most useful version of a source system table, which we can use as a new modular component for our project. In our experience, joins are almost always a bad idea here — they create immediate duplicated computation and confusing relationships that ripple downstream — there are occasionally exceptions though (refer to [base models](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/2-staging?version=1.12#staging-other-considerations) for more info).
    * ❌ **Aggregations** — aggregations entail grouping, and we're not doing that at this stage. Remember - staging models are your place to create the building blocks you’ll use all throughout the rest of your project — if we start changing the grain of our tables by grouping in this layer, we’ll lose access to source data that we’ll likely need at some point. We just want to get our individual concepts cleaned and ready for use, and will handle aggregating values downstream.
  * ✅ **Materialized as views.** Looking at a partial view of our `dbt_project.yml` below, we can see that we’ve configured the entire staging directory to be materialized as views
    * Any downstream model (discussed more in [marts](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/4-marts)) referencing our staging models will always get the freshest data possible from all of the component views it’s pulling together and materializing
    * It avoids wasting space in the warehouse on models that are not intended to be queried by data consumers, and thus do not need to perform as quickly or efficiently
```
# dbt_project.ymlmodels:jaffle_shop:staging:+materialized: view
```

  * Staging models are the only place we'll use the [`source` macro](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/sources), and our staging models should have a 1-to-1 relationship to our source tables. That means for each source system table we’ll have a single staging model referencing it, acting as its entry point — _staging_ it — for use downstream.


Staging models help us keep our code DRY
This is a welcome change for many of us who have become used to applying the same sets of SQL transformations in many places out of necessity! For us, the earliest point for these 'always-want' transformations is the staging layer, the initial entry point in our transformation process. The DRY principle is ultimately the litmus test for whether transformations should happen in the staging layer. If we'll want them in every downstream model and they help us eliminate repeated code, they're probably okay.
### Staging: Other considerations[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/2-staging?version=1.12#staging-other-considerations "Direct link to Staging: Other considerations")
  * **Base models when joins are necessary to stage concepts.** Sometimes, in order to maintain a clean and DRY`base` models. These have all the same properties that would normally be in the staging layer, they will directly source the raw data and do the non-joining transformations, then in the staging models we’ll join the requisite base models. The most common use cases for building a base layer under a staging folder are:
    * ✅ **Joining in separate delete tables**. Sometimes a source system might store deletes in a separate table. Typically we’ll want to make sure we can mark or filter out deleted records for all our component models, so we’ll need to join these delete records up to any of our entities that follow this pattern. This is the example shown below to illustrate.
```
-- base_jaffle_shop__customers.sqlsource as(select*from {{ source('jaffle_shop','customers') }}customers as(selectas customer_id,        first_name,        last_namefrom sourceselect*from customers

```

    * ✅ **Unioning disparate but symmetrical sources**. A typical example here would be if you operate multiple ecommerce platforms in various territories via a SaaS platform like Shopify. You would have perfectly identical schemas, but all loaded separately into your warehouse. In this case, it’s easier to reason about our orders if _all_ of our shops are unioned together, so we’d want to handle the unioning in a base model before we carry on with our usual staging model transformations on the (now complete) set — you can dig into [more detail on this use case here](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/unioning-identically-structured-data-sources/921).
  * **[Codegen](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-codegen) to automate staging table generation.** It’s very good practice to learn to write staging models by hand, they’re straightforward and numerous, so they can be an excellent way to absorb the dbt style of writing SQL. Also, we’ll invariably find ourselves needing to add special elements to specific models at times — for instance, in one of the situations above that require base models — so it’s helpful to deeply understand how they work. Once that understanding is established though, because staging models are built largely following the same rote patterns and need to be built 1-to-1 for each source table in a source system, it’s preferable to start automating their creation. For this, we have the [codegen](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-codegen) package. This will let you automatically generate all the source YAML and staging model boilerplate to speed up this step, and we recommend using it in every project.
  * **Utilities folder.** While this is not in the `staging` folder, it’s useful to consider as part of our fundamental building blocks. The `models/utilities` directory is where we can keep any general purpose models that we generate from macros or based on seeds that provide tools to help us do our modeling, rather than data to model itself. The most common use case is a [date spine](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils#date_spine-source) generated with [the dbt utils package](https://hub.getdbt.com/dbt-labs/dbt_utils/latest/).


This guide follows the order of the DAG, so we can get a holistic picture of how these three primary layers build on each other towards fueling impactful data products. It’s important to note though that developing models does not typically move linearly through the DAG. Most commonly, we should start by mocking out a design in a spreadsheet so we know we’re aligned with our stakeholders on output goals. Then, we’ll want to write the SQL to generate that output, and identify what tables are involved. Once we have our logic and dependencies, we’ll make sure we’ve staged all the necessary atomic pieces into the project, then bring them together based on the logic we wrote to generate our mart. Finally, with a functioning model flowing in dbt, we can start refactoring and optimizing that mart. By splitting the logic up and moving parts back upstream into intermediate models, we ensure all of our models are clean and readable, the story of our DAG is clear, and we have more surface area to apply thorough testing.

On this page
So far we’ve looked at tables and views, which map to the traditional objects in the data warehouse. As mentioned earlier, incremental models are a little different. This is where we start to deviate from this pattern with more powerful and complex materializations.
  * 📚 **Incremental models generate tables.** They physically persist the data itself to the warehouse, just piece by piece. What’s different is **how we build that table**.
  * 💅 **Only apply our transformations to rows of data with new or updated information** , this maximizes efficiency.
    * 🌍 If we have a very large set of data or compute-intensive transformations, or both, it can be very slow and costly to process the entire corpus of source data being input into a model or chain of models. If instead we can identify _only rows that contain new information_ (that is, **new or updated records**), we then can process just those rows, building our models _incrementally_.
  * 3️⃣ We need **3 key things** in order to accomplish the above:
    * a **filter** to select just the new or updated records
    * a **conditional block** that wraps our filter and only applies it when we want it
    * **configuration** that tells dbt we want to build incrementally and helps apply the conditional filter when needed


Let’s dig into how exactly we can do that in dbt. Let’s say we have an `orders` table that looks like the below:
order_id | order_status | customer_id | order_item_id | ordered_at | updated_at
---|---|---|---|---|---
123 | shipped | 7 | 5791 | 2022-01-30 | 2022-01-30
234 | confirmed | 15 | 1643 | 2022-01-31 | 2022-01-31
order_id |  order_status |  customer_id |  order_item_id |  ordered_at |  updated_at
---|---|---|---|---|---
123 | shipped | 7 | 5791 | 2022-01-30 | 2022-01-30
234 | confirmed | 15 | 1643 | 2022-01-31 | 2022-01-31
We did our last `dbt build` job on `2022-01-31`, so any new orders since that run won’t appear in our table. When we do our next run (for simplicity let’s say the next day, although for an orders model we’d more realistically run this hourly), we have two options:
  * 🏔️ build the table from the **beginning of time again — a _table materialization_**
    * Simple and solid, if we can afford to do it (in terms of time, compute, and money — which are all directly correlated in a cloud warehouse). It’s the easiest and most accurate option.
  * 🤏 find a way to run **just new and updated rows since our previous run — _an_ _incremental materialization_**
    * If we _can’t_ realistically afford to run the whole table — due to complex transformations or big source data, it takes too long — then we want to build incrementally. We want to just transform and add the row with id 567 below, _not_ the previous two with ids 123 and 234 that are already in the table.


order_id | order_status | customer_id | order_item_id | ordered_at | updated_at
---|---|---|---|---|---
123 | shipped | 7 | 5791 | 2022-01-30 | 2022-01-30
234 | confirmed | 15 | 1643 | 2022-01-31 | 2022-01-31
567 | shipped | 61 | 28 | 2022-02-01 | 2022-02-01
order_id |  order_status |  customer_id |  order_item_id |  ordered_at |  updated_at
---|---|---|---|---|---
123 | shipped | 7 | 5791 | 2022-01-30 | 2022-01-30
234 | confirmed | 15 | 1643 | 2022-01-31 | 2022-01-31
567 | shipped | 61 | 28 | 2022-02-01 | 2022-02-01
### Writing incremental logic[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/materializations/4-incremental-models?version=1.12#writing-incremental-logic "Direct link to Writing incremental logic")
Let’s think through the information we’d need to build such a model that only processes new and updated data. We would need:
  * 🕜 **a timestamp indicating when a record was last updated** , let’s call it our `updated_at` timestamp, as that’s a typical convention and what we have in our example above.
  * ⌛ the **most recent timestamp from this table _in our warehouse_** _—_ that is, the one created by the previous run — to act as a cutoff point. We’ll call the model we’re working in `this`, for ‘this model we’re working in’.


That would lets us construct logic like this:
```
select*from orders  updated_at (selectmax(updated_at)from {{ this }})
```

Let’s break down that `where` clause a bit, because this is where the action is with incremental models. Stepping through the code **_right-to-left_** we:
  1. Get our **cutoff.**
    1. Select the `max(updated_at)` timestamp — the **most recent record**
    2. from `{{ this }}` — the table for this model as it exists in the warehouse, as **built in our last run** ,
    3. so `max(updated_at) from {{ this }}` the **_most recent record processed in our last run,_**
    4. that’s exactly what we want as a **cutoff**!
  2. **Filter** the rows we’re selecting to add in this run.
    1. Use the `updated_at` timestamp from our input, the equivalent column to the one in the warehouse, but in the up-to-the-minute **source data we’re selecting from** and
    2. check if it’s **greater than our cutoff,**
    3. if so it will satisfy our where clause, so we’re **selecting all the rows more recent than our cutoff.**


This logic would let us isolate and apply our transformations to just the records that have come in since our last run, and I’ve got some great news: that magic `{{ this }}` keyword [does in fact exist in dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/this), so we can write exactly this logic in our models.
### Configuring incremental models[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/materializations/4-incremental-models?version=1.12#configuring-incremental-models "Direct link to Configuring incremental models")
So we’ve found a way to isolate the new rows we need to process. How then do we handle the rest? We still need to:
  * ➕ make sure dbt knows to **_add_ new rows on top** of the existing table in the warehouse, **not replace** it.
  * 👉 If there are **updated rows** , we need a way for dbt to know **which rows to update**.
  * 🌍 Lastly, if we’re building into a new environment and there’s **no previous run to reference** , or we need to **build the model from scratch.** Put another way, we’ll want a means to skip the incremental logic and transform all of our input data like a regular table if needed.
  * 😎 **Visualized below** , we’ve figured out how to get the red ‘new records’ portion selected, but we need to sort out the step to the right, where we stick those on to our model.


😌 Incremental models can be confusing at first, **take your time reviewing** this visual and the previous steps until you have a **clear mental model.** Be patient with yourself. This materialization will become second nature soon, but it’s tough at first. If you’re feeling confused the [dbt Community is here for you on the Forum and Slack](https://www.getdbt.com/community/join-the-community).
Thankfully dbt has some additional configuration and special syntax just for incremental models.
First, let's look at a config block for incremental materialization:
```
    config(        materialized='incremental',        unique_key='order_id'select...
```

  * 📚 The **`materialized`config** works just like tables and views, we just pass it the value `'incremental'`.
  * 🔑 We’ve **added a new config option`unique_key` ,** that tells dbt that if it finds a record in our previous run — the data in the warehouse already — with the same unique id (in our case `order_id` for our `orders` table) that exists in the new data we’re adding incrementally, to **update that record instead of adding it as a separate row**.
  * 👯 This **hugely broadens the types of data we can build incrementally** from just immutable tables (data where rows only ever get added, never updated) to mutable records (where rows might change over time). As long as we’ve got a column that specifies when records were updated (such as `updated_at` in our example), we can handle almost anything.
  * ➕ We’re now **adding records** to the table **and updating existing rows**. That’s 2 of 3 concerns.
  * 🆕 We still need to **build the table from scratch** (via `dbt build` or `run` in a job) when necessary — whether because we’re in a new environment so don’t have an initial table to build on, or our model has drifted from the original over time due to data loading latency.
  * 🔀 We need to wrap our incremental logic, that is our `where` clause with our `updated_at` cutoff, in a **conditional statement that will only apply it when certain conditions are met**. If you’re thinking this is **a case for a Jinja`{% if %}` statement**, you’re absolutely right!


### Incremental conditions[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/materializations/4-incremental-models?version=1.12#incremental-conditions "Direct link to Incremental conditions")
So we’re going to use an **if statement** to apply our cutoff filter **only when certain conditions are met**. We want to apply our cutoff filter _if_ the **following things are true** :
  * ➕ we’ve set the materialization **config** to incremental,
  * 🛠️ there is an **existing table** for this model in the warehouse to build on,
  * 🙅‍♀️ and the `--full-refresh` **flag was _not_ passed.**
    * [full refresh](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/full_refresh) is a configuration and flag that is specifically designed to let us override the incremental materialization and build a table from scratch again.


Thankfully, we don’t have to dig into the guts of dbt to sort out each of these conditions individually.
  * ⚙️ dbt provides us with a **macro[`is_incremental`](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-models#understand-the-is_incremental-macro)** that checks all of these conditions for this exact use case.
  * 🔀 By **wrapping our cutoff logic** in this macro, it will only get applied when the macro returns true for all of the above conditions.


Let’s take a look at all these pieces together:
```
    config(        materialized='incremental',        unique_key='order_id'select*from orders{%if is_incremental()%}  updated_at (selectmax(updated_at)from {{ this }}){% endif %}
```

Fantastic! We’ve got a working incremental model. On our first run, when there is no corresponding table in the warehouse, `is_incremental` will evaluate to false and we’ll capture the entire table. On subsequent runs it will evaluate to true and we’ll apply our filter logic, capturing only the newer data.
### Late-arriving facts[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/materializations/4-incremental-models?version=1.12#late-arriving-facts "Direct link to Late-arriving facts")
Our last concern specific to incremental models is what to do when data is inevitably loaded in a less-than-perfect way. Sometimes data loaders will, for a variety of reasons, load data late. Either an entire load comes in late, or some rows come in on a load after those with which they should have. The following is best practice for every incremental model to slow down the drift this can cause.
  * 🕐 For example if most of our records for `2022-01-30` come in the raw schema of our warehouse on the morning of `2022-01-31`, but a handful don’t get loaded til `2022-02-02`, how might we tackle that? There will already be `max(updated_at)` timestamps of `2022-01-31` in the warehouse, filtering out those late records. **They’ll never make it to our model.**
  * 🪟 To mitigate this, we can add a **lookback window** to our **cutoff** point. By **subtracting a few days** from the `max(updated_at)`, we would capture any late data within the window of what we subtracted.
  * 👯 As long as we have a **`unique_key`defined in our config** , we’ll simply update existing rows and avoid duplication. We process more data this way, but in a fixed way, and it keeps our model hewing closer to the source data.


#### Using state-aware orchestration with incremental models[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/materializations/4-incremental-models?version=1.12#using-state-aware-orchestration-with-incremental-models "Direct link to Using state-aware orchestration with incremental models")
By default, [state-aware orchestration](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/state-aware-about) detects source freshness by checking warehouse metadata for any new rows. This may cause models to run more often than needed.
To avoid this issue, configure a `loaded_at_field` for a specific timestamp column or use a `loaded_at_query` with custom SQL to tell dbt which field to check for freshness. This helps state-aware orchestration to detect only genuinely new data. For information on how to configure `loaded_at_field` and `loaded_at_query`, refer to [Source freshness](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/freshness) and [Advanced configurations](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/state-aware-setup#advanced-configurations).
Even with a `loaded_at_field` or `loaded_at_query`, late arriving records may have an earlier event timestamp (for example, `event_date`). In this case, state-aware orchestration may skip rebuilding the incremental model, even though your lookback window would normally pick up those records. To ensure late-arriving data is detected, configure your `loaded_at_query` to align with the same lookback window used in your incremental filter. For example, if your incremental model uses a 3-day lookback window:
```
sources:-name: raw_orderstables:-name: ordersconfig:loaded_at_query:|            select max(ingested_at)            from {{ this }}            where ingested_at >= current_timestamp - interval '3 days'
```

### Long-term considerations[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/materializations/4-incremental-models?version=1.12#long-term-considerations "Direct link to Long-term considerations")
Late arriving facts point to the biggest tradeoff with incremental models:
  * 🪢 In addition to extra **complexity** , they also inevitably **drift from the source data over time.** Due to the imperfection of loaders and the reality of late arriving facts, we can’t help but miss some day in-between our incremental runs, and this accumulates.
  * 🪟 We can slow this entropy with the lookback window described above — **the longer the window the less efficient the model, but the slower the drift.** It’s important to note it will still occur though, however slowly. If we have a lookback window of 3 days, and a record comes in 4 days late from the loader, we’re still going to miss it.
  * 🌍 Thankfully, there is a way we can reset the relationship of the model to the source data. We can run the model with the **`--full-refresh`flag passed** (such as `dbt build --full-refresh -s orders`). As we saw in the `is_incremental` conditions above, that will make our logic return false, and our `where` clause filter will not be applied, running the whole table.
  * 🏗️ This will let us **rebuild the entire table from scratch,** a good practice to do regularly **if the size of the data will allow**.
  * 📆 A common pattern for incremental models of manageable size is to run a **full refresh on the weekend** (or any low point in activity), either **weekly or monthly** , to consistently reset the drift from late arriving facts.

## How to build a semantic model[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-3-build-semantic-models?version=1.12#how-to-build-a-semantic-model "Direct link to How to build a semantic model")
A semantic model is the Semantic Layer equivalent to a logical layer model (what historically has just been called a 'model' in dbt land). Just as configurations for models are defined on the `models:` YAML key, configurations for semantic models are housed under `semantic models:`. A key difference is that while a logical model consists of configuration and SQL or Python code, a **semantic model is defined purely via YAML**. Rather than encoding a specific dataset, a **semantic model describes relationships and expressions** that let your end users select and refine their own datasets dynamically and reliably.
  * ⚙️ Semantic models are **comprised of three components** :
    * 🫂 **entities** : these describe the **relationships** between various semantic models (think ids)
    * 🔪 **dimensions** : these are the columns you want to **slice, dice, group, and filter by** (think timestamps, categories, booleans).
    * 📏 **measures** : these are the **quantitative values you want to aggregate**
  * 🪣 We define **columns as being an entity, dimension, or measure**. Columns will typically fit into one of these 3 buckets, or if they're a complex aggregation expression, they might constitute a metric.


## Defining orders[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-3-build-semantic-models?version=1.12#defining-orders "Direct link to Defining orders")
Let's zoom in on how we might define an _orders_ semantic model.
  * 📗 We define it as a **YAML dictionary in the`semantic_models` list**.
  * 📑 It will have a **name, entities list, dimensions list, and measures list**.
  * ⏬ We recommend defining them **in this order consistently** as a style best practice.


models/marts/orders.yml
```
semantic_models:-name: ordersentities:...# we'll define these laterdimensions:...# we'll define these latermeasures:...# we'll define these later
```

  * Next we'll point to the corresponding logical model by supplying a [`ref`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/ref) in the `model:` property, and a `description` for documentation.


models/marts/orders.yml
```
semantic_models:-name: ordersdescription:|      Model containing order data. The grain of the table is the order id.model: ref('stg_orders')entities:...dimensions:...measures:...
```

## Establishing our entities[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-3-build-semantic-models?version=1.12#establishing-our-entities "Direct link to Establishing our entities")
  * 🫂 Entities are the **objects and concepts** in our data that _have_ dimensions and measures. You can think of them as the **nouns** of our project, the **spines** of our queries that we may want to aggregate by, or simply the **join keys**.
  * 🔀 Entities help MetricFlow understand **how various semantic models relate to one another**.
  * ⛓️ Unlike many other semantic layers, in MetricFlow **we do not need to describe joins explicitly** , instead the **relationships are implicitly described by entities**.
  * 1️⃣ Each semantic model should have **one primary entity** defined for itself, and **any number of foreign entities** for other semantic models it may join to.
  * 🫂 Entities require a **name and type**
    * 🔑 Types available are **primary** , **foreign** , **unique** or **natural** — we'll be focused on the first two for now, but you can [read more about unique and natural keys](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/entities#entity-types).


### Entities in action[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-3-build-semantic-models?version=1.12#entities-in-action "Direct link to Entities in action")
If we look at an example staging model for orders, we see that it has 3 id columns, so we'll need three entities.
models/staging/stg_orders.sql
```
renamed as(select----------  idsas order_id,        store_id as location_id,        customer as customer_id,---------- properties(order_total /100.0)as order_total,(tax_paid /100.0)as tax_paid,---------- timestamps        ordered_atfrom source
```

  * 👉 We add them with a **`name`,`type` , and optional `expr`** (expression). The expression can be any valid SQL expression on your platform.
  * 📛 If you **don't add an expression** , MetricFlow will **assume the name is equal to the column name** in the underlying logical model.
  * 👍 Our best practices pattern is to, whenever possible, provide a `name` that is the singular form of the subject or grain of the table, and use `expr` to specify the precise column name (with `_id` etc). This will let us write **more readable metrics** on top of these semantic models. For example, we'll use `location` instead of `location_id`.


models/marts/orders.yml
```
semantic_models:-name: ordersentities:# we use the column for the name here because order is a reserved word in SQL-name: order_idtype: primary-name: locationtype: foreignexpr: location_id-name: customertype: foreignexpr: customer_iddimensions:measures:
```

## Defining our dimensions[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-3-build-semantic-models?version=1.12#defining-our-dimensions "Direct link to Defining our dimensions")
  * 🧮 Dimensions are the columns that we want to **filter and group by** , **the adjectives of our project**. They come in three types:
    * **categorical**
    * **time**
    * slowly changing dimensions — [these are covered in the documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/dimensions#scd-type-ii), and a little more complex. To focus on building your mental models of MetricFlow's fundamentals, we won't be using SCDs in this guide.
  * ➕ We're **not limited to existing columns** , we can use the `expr` property to add simple computations in our dimensions.
  * 📛 Categorical dimensions are the simplest, they simply require a `name` and `type` (type being categorical). **If the`name` property matches the name of the dimension column**, that's it, you're done. If you want or need to use a `name` other than the column name, or do some filtering or computation, **you can supply an optional`expr` property** to evaluate for the dimension.


### Dimensions in action[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-3-build-semantic-models?version=1.12#dimensions-in-action "Direct link to Dimensions in action")
  * 👀 Let's look at our staging model again and see what fields we have available.


models/staging/stg_orders.sql
```
select----------  ids -> entities    id as order_id,    store_id as location_id,    customer as customer_id,---------- numerics -> measures(order_total /100.0)as order_total,(tax_paid /100.0)as tax_paid,---------- timestamps -> dimensions    ordered_atfrom source
```

  * ⏰ For now the only dimension to add is a **time dimension** : `ordered_at`.
  * 🕰️ At least one **primary time dimension** is **required** for any semantic models that **have measures**.
  * 1️⃣ We denote this with the `is_primary` property, or if there is only a one-time dimension supplied it is primary by default. Below we only have `ordered_at` as a timestamp so we don't need to specify anything except the _minimum granularity_ we're bucketing to (in this case, day). By this we mean that we're not going to be looking at orders at a finer granularity than a day.


models/marts/orders.yml
```
dimensions:-name: ordered_atexpr: date_trunc('day', ordered_at)type: timetype_params:time_granularity: day
```

**Dimensional models**. You may have some models that do not contain measures, just dimensional data that enriches other facts. That's totally fine, a semantic model does not require dimensions or measures, it just needs a primary entity, and if you do have measures, a primary time dimension.
We'll discuss an alternate situation, dimensional tables that have static numeric values like supply costs or tax rates but no time dimensions, later in the Guide.
  * 🔢 We can also **make a dimension out of a numeric column** that would typically be a measure.
  * 🪣 Using `expr` we can **create buckets of values that we label** for our dimension. We'll add one of these in for labeling 'large orders' as any order totals over $50.


models/marts/orders.yml
```
dimensions:-name: ordered_atexpr: date_trunc('day', ordered_at)type: timetype_params:time_granularity: day-name: is_large_ordertype: categoricalexpr: case when order_total  50 then true else false end
```

## Making our measures[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-3-build-semantic-models?version=1.12#making-our-measures "Direct link to Making our measures")
  * 📏 Measures are the final component of a semantic model. They describe the **numeric values that we want to aggregate**.
  * 🧱 Measures form **the building blocks of metrics** , with entities and dimensions helping us combine, group, and filter those metrics correctly.
  * 🏃 You can think of them as something like the **verbs of a semantic model**.


### Measures in action[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-3-build-semantic-models?version=1.12#measures-in-action "Direct link to Measures in action")
  * 👀 Let's look at **our staging model** one last time and see what **fields we want to measure**.


models/staging/stg_orders.sql
```
select----------  ids -> entities    id as order_id,    store_id as location_id,    customer as customer_id,---------- numerics -> measures(order_total /100.0)as order_total,(tax_paid /100.0)as tax_paid,---------- timestamps -> dimensions    ordered_atfrom source
```

  * ➕ Here `order_total` and `tax paid` are the **columns we want as measures**.
  * 📝 We can describe them via the code below, specifying a **name, description, aggregation, and expression**.
  * 👍 As before MetricFlow will default to the **name being the name of a column when no expression is supplied**.
  * 🧮 [Many different aggregations](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/measures#aggregation) are available to us. Here we just want sums.


models/marts/orders.yml
```
measures:-name: order_totaldescription: The total amount for each order including taxes.agg: sum-name: tax_paiddescription: The total tax paid on each order.agg: sum
```

  * 🆕 We can also **create new measures using expressions** , for instance adding a count of individual orders as below.


models/marts/orders.yml
```
-name: order_countdescription: The count of individual orders.expr:1agg: sum
```

## Reviewing our work[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-3-build-semantic-models?version=1.12#reviewing-our-work "Direct link to Reviewing our work")
Our completed code will look like this, our first semantic model! Here are two examples showing different organizational approaches:
Co-located approach
models/marts/orders.yml
```
semantic_models:-name: ordersdefaults:agg_time_dimension: ordered_atdescription:|      Order fact table. This table is at the order grain with one row per order.model: ref('stg_orders')entities:-name: order_idtype: primary-name: locationtype: foreignexpr: location_id-name: customertype: foreignexpr: customer_iddimensions:-name: ordered_atexpr: date_trunc('day', ordered_at)# use date_trunc(ordered_at, DAY) if using BigQuerytype: timetype_params:time_granularity: day-name: is_large_ordertype: categoricalexpr: case when order_total  50 then true else false endmeasures:-name: order_totaldescription: The total revenue for each order.agg: sum-name: order_countdescription: The count of individual orders.agg: sum-name: tax_paiddescription: The total tax paid on each order.agg: sum
```

Parallel sub-folder approach
models/semantic_models/sem_orders.yml
```
semantic_models:-name: ordersdefaults:agg_time_dimension: ordered_atdescription:|      Order fact table. This table is at the order grain with one row per order.model: ref('stg_orders')entities:-name: order_idtype: primary-name: locationtype: foreignexpr: location_id-name: customertype: foreignexpr: customer_iddimensions:-name: ordered_atexpr: date_trunc('day', ordered_at)# use date_trunc(ordered_at, DAY) if using BigQuerytype: timetype_params:time_granularity: day-name: is_large_ordertype: categoricalexpr: case when order_total  50 then true else false endmeasures:-name: order_totaldescription: The total revenue for each order.agg: sum-name: order_countdescription: The count of individual orders.agg: sum-name: tax_paiddescription: The total tax paid on each order.agg: sum
```

As you can see, the content of the semantic model is identical in both approaches. The key differences are:
  1. **File location**
     * Co-located approach: `models/marts/orders.yml`
     * Parallel sub-folder approach: `models/semantic_models/sem_orders.yml`
  2. **File naming**
     * Co-located approach: Uses the same name as the corresponding mart (`orders.yml`)
     * Parallel sub-folder approach: Prefixes the file with `sem_` (`sem_orders.yml`)


Choose the approach that best fits your project structure and team preferences. The co-located approach is often simpler for new projects, while the parallel sub-folder approach can be clearer for migrating large existing projects to the Semantic Layer.
## Next steps[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-build-our-metrics/semantic-layer-3-build-semantic-models?version=1.12#next-steps "Direct link to Next steps")
Let's review the basics of semantic models:
  * 🧱 Consist of **entities, dimensions, and measures**.
  * 🫂 Describe the **semantics and relationships of objects** in the warehouse.
  * 1️⃣ Correspond to a **single logical model** in your dbt project.


Next up, let's use our new semantic model to **build a metric**!

### Where should your mesh journey start?[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-4-implementation?version=1.12#where-should-your-mesh-journey-start "Direct link to Where should your mesh journey start?")
Moving to a Mesh represents a meaningful change in development and deployment architecture. Before any sufficiently complex software refactor or migration, it's important to ask, 'Why might this not work?' The two most common reasons we've seen stem from
  1. Lack of buy-in that a Mesh is the right long-term architecture
  2. Lack of alignment on a well-scoped starting point


Creating alignment on your architecture and starting point are major steps in ensuring a successful migration. Deciding on the right starting point will look different for every organization, but there are some heuristics that can help you decide where to start. In all likelihood, your organization already has logical components, and you may already be grouping, building, and deploying your project according to these interfaces.The goal is to define and formalize these organizational interfaces and use these boundaries to split your project apart by domain.
How do you find these organizational interfaces? Here are some steps to get you started:
  * **Talk to teams** about what sort of separation naturally exists right now.
    * Are there various domains people are focused on?
    * Are there various sizes, shapes, and sources of data that get handled separately (such as click event data)?
    * Are there people focused on separate levels of transformation, such as landing and staging data or building marts?
    * Is there a single team that is _downstream_ of your current dbt project, who could more easily migrate onto Mesh as a consumer?


When attempting to define your project interfaces, you should consider investigating:
  * **Your jobs:** Which sets of models are most often built together?
  * **Your lineage graph:** How are models connected?
  * **Your selectors(defined in`selectors.yml`):** How do people already define resource groups?


Let's go through an example process of taking a monolithing project, using groups and access to define the interfaces, and then splitting it into multiple projects.
To help you get started, check out our [Quickstart with Mesh](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/mesh-qs) or our online [Mesh course](https://learn.getdbt.com/courses/dbt-mesh) to learn more!
## Defining project interfaces with groups and access[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-4-implementation?version=1.12#defining-project-interfaces-with-groups-and-access "Direct link to Defining project interfaces with groups and access")
Once you have a sense of some initial groupings, you can first implement **group and access permissions** within a single project.
  * First you can create a [group](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/groups) to define the owner of a set of models.


```
# in models/__groups.ymlgroups:-name: marketingowner:name: Ben Jaffleck email: ben.jaffleck@jaffleshop.com
```

  * Then, we can add models to that group using the `group:` key in the model's YAML entry.


```
# in models/marketing/__models.ymlmodels:-name: fct_marketing_modelconfig:group: marketing # changed to config in v1.10-name: stg_marketing_modelconfig:group: marketing # changed to config in v1.10
```

  * Once you've added models to the group, you can **add[access](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/model-access) settings to the models** based on their connections between groups, _opting for the most private access that will maintain current functionality_. This means that any model that has _only_ relationships to other models in the same group should be `private` , and any model that has cross-group relationships, or is a terminal node in the group DAG should be `protected` so that other parts of the DAG can continue to reference it.


```
# in models/marketing/__models.ymlmodels:-name: fct_marketing_modelconfig:group: marketing # changed to config in v1.10access: protected # changed to config in v1.10-name: stg_marketing_modelconfig:group: marketing # changed to config in v1.10access: private # changed to config in v1.10
```

  * **Validate these groups by incrementally migrating your jobs** to execute these groups specifically via selection syntax. We would recommend doing this in parallel to your production jobs until you’re sure about them. This will help you feel out if you’ve drawn the lines in the right place.
  * If you find yourself **consistently making changes across multiple groups** when you update logic, that’s a sign that **you may want to rethink your groups**.


## Split your projects[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-4-implementation?version=1.12#split-your-projects "Direct link to Split your projects")
  1. **Move your grouped models into a subfolder**. This will include any model in the selected group, it's associated YAML entry, as well as its parent or child resources as appropriate depending on where this group sits in your DAG.
    1. Note that just like in your dbt project, circular references are not allowed! Project B cannot have parents and children in Project A, for example.
  2. **Create a new`dbt_project.yml` file** in the subdirectory.
  3. **Copy any macros** used by the resources you moved.
  4. **Create a new`packages.yml` file** in your subdirectory with the packages that are used by the resources you moved.
  5. **Update`{{ ref }}` functions** — For any model that has a cross-project dependency (this may be in the files you moved, or in the files that remain in your project):
    1. Update the `{{ ref() }}` function to have two arguments, where the first is the name of the source project and the second is the name of the model: e.g. `{{ ref('jaffle_shop', 'my_upstream_model') }}`
    2. Update the upstream, cross-project parents’ `access` configs to `public` , ensuring any project can safely `{{ ref() }}` those models.
    3. We _highly_ recommend adding a [model contract](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/model-contracts) to the upstream models to ensure the data shape is consistent and reliable for your downstream consumers.
  6. **Create a`dependencies.yml` file** ([docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/mesh/govern/project-dependencies)) for the downstream project, declaring the upstream project as a dependency.


```
# in dependencies.ymlprojects:-name: jaffle_shop
```

### Best practices[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-4-implementation?version=1.12#best-practices "Direct link to Best practices")
  * When you’ve **confirmed the right groups** , it's time to split your projects.
    * **Do _one_ group at a time**!
    * **Do _not_ refactor as you migrate**, however tempting that may be. Focus on getting 1-to-1 parity and log any issues you find in doing the migration for later. Once you’ve fully migrated the project then you can start optimizing it for its new life as part of your mesh.
  * Start by splitting your project within the same repository for full git tracking and easy reversion if you need to start from scratch.


## Connecting existing projects[​](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-4-implementation?version=1.12#connecting-existing-projects "Direct link to Connecting existing projects")
Some organizations may already be coordinating across multiple dbt projects. Most often this is via:
  1. Installing parent projects as dbt packages
  2. Using `{{ source() }}` functions to read the outputs of a parent project as inputs to a child project.


This has a few drawbacks:
  1. If using packages, each project has to include _all_ resources from _all_ projects in its manifest, slowing down dbt and the development cycle.
  2. If using sources, there are breakages in the lineage, as there's no real connection between the parent and child projects.


The migration steps here are much simpler than splitting up a monolith!
  1. If using the `package` method:
    1. In the parent project:
      1. mark all models being referenced downstream as `public` and add a model contract.
    2. In the child project:
      1. Remove the package entry from `packages.yml`
      2. Add the upstream project to your `dependencies.yml`
      3. Update the `{{ ref() }}` functions to models from the upstream project to include the project name argument.
  2. If using `source` method:
    1. In the parent project:
      1. mark all models being imported downstream as `public` and add a model contract.
    2. In the child project:
      1. Add the upstream project to your `dependencies.yml`
      2. Replace the `{{ source() }}` functions with cross project `{{ ref() }}` functions.
      3. Remove the unnecessary `source` definitions.

We've provided a set of example projects you can use to explore the topics covered here. We've split our [Jaffle Shop](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle-shop) project into 3 separate projects in a multi-repo Mesh. Note that you'll need to leverage dbt to use multi-project architecture, as cross-project references are powered via dbt's APIs.

You're now following best practices in your project, and have optimized the materializations of your DAG. You’re equipped with the 3 main materializations that cover almost any analytics engineering situation!
There are more configs and materializations available, as well as specific materializations for certain platforms and adapters — and like everything with dbt, materializations are extensible, meaning you can create your own [custom materializations](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/create-new-materializations) for your needs. So this is just the beginning of what you can do with these powerful configurations.
For the vast majority of users and companies though, tables, views, and incremental models will handle everything you can throw at them. Develop your intuition and expertise for these materializations, and you’ll be well on your way to tackling advanced analytics engineering problems.
